8 |     value: Vc<i32>,
  |            ^^^^^^^ the trait `ResolvedValue` is not implemented for `Vc<i32>`

  = help: the following other types implement trait `ResolvedValue`:
            &T
            &mut T
            ()
            (A, Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T)

            (D, C, B, A, Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T)
            (E, D, C, B, A, Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T)
          and $N others
