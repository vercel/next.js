/// A "subtype" (can be converted via [`.connect()`]) of [`Vc`] that
/// represents a specific call (with arguments) to [a task][macro@crate::function].
///
/// Unlike [`Vc`], `OperationVc`:
///
/// - Does not potentially refer to task-local information, meaning that it implements
///   [`NonLocalValue`], and can be used in any [`#[turbo_tasks::value]`][macro@crate::value].
///
/// - Has only one potential internal representation, meaning that it has a saner equality
///   definition.
///
/// - Can be [reconnected][OperationVc::connect] to the strongly-consistent compilation graph after
///   being placed inside of a [`State`].
///
/// - Makes sense with [collectibles][`CollectiblesSource`], as it represents a function call, and
///   only function calls can have issues or side-effects.
///
///
/// ## Equality & Hashing
///
/// Equality between two `OperationVc`s means that both have an identical in-memory representation
/// and point to the same task function call. The implementation of [`Hash`] has similar behavior.
///
/// If [connected] and then `.await`ed at the same time, both would likely resolve to the same
/// [`ReadRef`], though it is possible that they may not if the task or cell is invalidated between
/// `.await`s.
///
/// Because equality is a synchronous operation that cannot read the cell contents, even if the
/// `OperationVc`s are not equal, it is possible that if `.await`ed, both `OperationVc`s could point
/// to the same or equal values.
///
/// [`.connect()`]: OperationVc::connect
/// [reconnected]: OperationVc::connect
/// [connected]: OperationVc::connect
/// [`NonLocalValue`]: crate::NonLocalValue
/// [`State`]: crate::State
/// [`ReadRef`]: crate::ReadRef
