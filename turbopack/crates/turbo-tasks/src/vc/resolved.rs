/// A "subtype" (via [`Deref`]) of [`Vc`] that represents a specific [`Vc::cell`]/`.cell()` or
/// [`ResolvedVc::cell`]/`.resolved_cell()` constructor call within [a task][macro@crate::function].
///
/// Unlike [`Vc`], `ResolvedVc`:
///
/// - Does not potentially refer to task-local information, meaning that it implements
///   [`NonLocalValue`], and can be used in any [`#[turbo_tasks::value]`][macro@crate::value].
///
/// - Has only one potential internal representation, meaning that it has a saner equality
///   definition.
///
/// - Points to a concrete value with a type, and is therefore [cheap to
///   downcast][ResolvedVc::try_downcast].
///
///
/// ## Construction
///
/// There are a few ways to construct a `ResolvedVc`, in order of preference:
///
/// 1. Given a [value][VcValueType], construct a `ResolvedVc` using [`ResolvedVc::cell`] (for
///    "transparent" values) or by calling the generated `.resolved_cell()` constructor on the value
///    type.
///
/// 2. Given an argument to a function using the [`#[turbo_tasks::function]`][macro@crate::function]
///    macro, change the argument's type to a `ResolvedVc`. The [rewritten external signature] will
///    still use [`Vc`], but when the function is called, the [`Vc`] will be resolved.
///
/// 3. Given a [`Vc`], use [`.to_resolved().await?`][Vc::to_resolved].
///
///
/// ## Equality & Hashing
///
/// Equality between two `ResolvedVc`s means that both have an identical in-memory representation
/// and point to the same cell. The implementation of [`Hash`] has similar behavior.
///
/// If `.await`ed at the same time, both would likely resolve to the same [`ReadRef`], though it is
/// possible that they may not if the cell is invalidated between `.await`s.
///
/// Because equality is a synchronous operation that cannot read the cell contents, even if the
/// `ResolvedVc`s are not equal, it is possible that if `.await`ed, both `ResolvedVc`s could point
/// to the same or equal values.
///
///
/// [`NonLocalValue`]: crate::NonLocalValue
/// [rewritten external signature]: https://turbopack-rust-docs.vercel.sh/turbo-engine/tasks.html#external-signature-rewriting
/// [`ReadRef`]: crate::ReadRef
