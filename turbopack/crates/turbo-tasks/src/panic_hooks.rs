//! Provides a central registry for safe runtime registration and de-registration of panic hooks.
//!
//! Registered hooks are called in an arbitrary order.
//!
//! This is used inside `turbo-tasks-backend` to invalidate the persistent cache if a panic occurs
//! anywhere inside of Turbopack. That panic hook must be dynamically registered as it contains a
//! reference to the database.
//!
//! The program using turbo-tasks must call [`std::panic::set_hook`] with [`handle_panic`] exactly
//! once for these registered panic handlers to function. Short-lived programs or code that does not
//! fully control its execution environment (like unit tests) may choose not to do this, so these
//! panic hooks are best-effort.
//!
//! It's recommended that when adding this global panic handler (or any other panic handler) that:
//! - You call it as early in the program as possible, to avoid race conditions with other threads.
//! - The new panic handler should call any existing panic handler.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::panic::{set_hook, take_hook};
//! use turbo_tasks::panic_hooks::handle_panic;
//!
//! let prev_hook = take_hook();
//! set_hook(Box::new(move |info| {
//!     handle_panic(info);
//!     prev_hook(info);
//! }));
//! ```
//!
//! This code is not particularly well-optimized under the assumption that panics are a rare
//! occurrence.
