  The export Abc was not found in module [project]/turbopack/crates/turbopack-tests/tests/execution/turbopack/exports/invalid-export/input/invalid-export/module.js [test] (ecmascript) <exports>.
  
  Did you mean to import Abd?
  
  All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
  
  
  | These are the exports of the module:
  | Abd, Eef, a, b, c
