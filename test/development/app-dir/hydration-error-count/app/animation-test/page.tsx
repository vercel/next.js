/**
 * This page is to verify that the Dev Tools surface animates as expected and without jank:
 *
 * 1. When the page loads with "1 Issue" present,
 *    no animations should trigger (count change, width growth, etc.).
 *    The surface should assume its intrinsic position immediately,
 *    while still animating when collapsed from (Ã—).
 *
 * 2. When multiple errors come in with little delay inbetween them,
 *    the count _should not_ animate when it changes because it will
 *    look janky when the `deltaMs` between changes is less than the `animationDurationMs`.
 *
 * 3. When another error comes in, and `deltaMs` is greater, the surface should
 *    subtly bounce and animate the count.
