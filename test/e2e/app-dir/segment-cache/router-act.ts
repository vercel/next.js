 *   scope. The blocked response will be fulfilled when the outer
 *   scope completes.
 *
 * The list of expected responses does not need to be exhaustive â€” any
 * responses that don't match will proceed like normal. However, `act` will
 * error if the expected substring is not found in any of the responses, or
 * if the expected responses are received out of order. It will also error
 * if the same expected substring is found in multiple responses.
 *
 * If no expected responses are provided, the only expectation is that at
 * least one request is initiated. (This is the same as passing an
 * empty array.)
 *
 * Alternatively, if no network activity is expected, pass "no-requests".
