title: Max Custom Routes Reached
---

## Why This Error Occurred

The number of combined routes from `headers`, `redirects`, and `rewrites` exceeds 1000. This can impact performance because each request will iterate over all routes to check for a match in the worst case.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Leverage dynamic routes inside of the `pages` folder to reduce the number of rewrites needed
- Combine headers routes into dynamic matches e.g. `/first-header-route` `/second-header-route` -> `/(first-header-route$|second-header-route$)`
