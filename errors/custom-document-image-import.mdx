title: Images cannot be imported into your custom document.
---

## Why This Error Occurred

An attempt to import an image file into [`pages/_document.js`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) was made.

Custom documents aren't compiled for the browser and images statically imported like this will not be displayed.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

If your image needs to be displayed on every page you can relocate it to your [`pages/_app.js`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) file.

### Example

```jsx filename="pages/_app.js"
import yourImage from 'path/to/your/image'
import Image from 'next/image'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Image src={yourImage} alt="your_image_description" />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

If your application is not using image imports with `next/image`, you can disable the built-in loader with the following `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  images: {
    disableStaticImages: true,
  },
}
```
