title: No Stylesheets In Head Component
---

## Why This Error Occurred

A `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag was added using the `next/head` component.

We don't recommend this pattern because it will potentially break when used with Suspense and/or streaming. In these contexts, `next/head` tags aren't:

- guaranteed to be included in the initial SSR response, so loading could be delayed until client-side rendering, regressing performance.

- loaded in any particular order. The order that the app's Suspense boundaries resolve will determine the loading order of your stylesheets.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

### Document

Add the stylesheet in a custom `Document` component.

```jsx filename="pages/_document.js"
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="..." />
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  )
}
```

Note that the functional syntax for `Document` above is preferred over the `class` syntax, so that it will be compatible with React Server Components down the line.
