title: Export with Image Optimization API
---

## Why This Error Occurred

You configured `output: 'export'` (or ran `next export`) while importing the `next/image` component using the default `loader` configuration.

However, the default `loader` relies on the Image Optimization API which is not available for exported applications.

This is because Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them (not at build time).

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Use [`next start`](/docs/pages/api-reference/cli/next#next-start-options) to run a server, which includes the Image Optimization API.
- Use any provider which supports Image Optimization (such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- [Configure `loader`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader) in `next.config.js`.
- [Configure `unoptimized`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) in `next.config.js`.
