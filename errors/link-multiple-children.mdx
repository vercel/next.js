title: 'Multiple children were passed to `<Link>`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In your application code multiple children were passed to `next/link` but only one child is supported:

For example:

```js filename="example.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>To About</a>
      <a>Second To About</a>
    </Link>
  )
}
```

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Make sure only one child is used when using `<Link>`:

```js filename="example.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>To About</a>
    </Link>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:**
>
> - As on Next.js 13.0, `<Link>` no longer requires a child `<a>` tag. A [codemod](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#remove-a-tags-from-link-components) is provided to automatically update your codebase.
