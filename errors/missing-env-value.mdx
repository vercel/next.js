title: Missing Env Value
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In one of your pages you attempted to access an environment value that is not provided in the environment.

When accessing environment variables on the client they must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to signify they are safe to be inlined for the client.

When accessing environment variables on the server in `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or an API route the value must be provided in the environment at runtime.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Either remove the code accessing the env value, populate it in your `.env` file, or manually populate it in your environment before running `next dev` or `next build`.
