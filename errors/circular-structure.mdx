title: 'Circular structure in `getInitialProps` result'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

`getInitialProps` is serialized to JSON using `JSON.stringify` and sent to the client side for hydrating the page.

However, the result returned from `getInitialProps` can't be serialized when it has a circular structure.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Circular structures are not supported, so the way to fix this error is removing the circular structure from the object that is returned from `getInitialProps`.

For example, the `req` instance exposed is a circular object and can not be serialized, instead the specific fields such as relevant headers on the instance should be passed specifically.
