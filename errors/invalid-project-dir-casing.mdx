title: Invalid Project Directory Casing
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When starting Next.js, the current directory is a different casing than the actual directory on your filesystem. This can cause files to resolve inconsistently.

This can occur when using a case-insensitive filesystem. For example, opening PowerShell on Windows navigating to `cd path/to/myproject` instead of `cd path/to/MyProject`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Ensure the casing for the current working directory matches the actual case of the real directory. Use a terminal that enforces case-sensitivity.
