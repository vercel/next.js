title: 'Invalid "use server" Value'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

This error occurs when a `"use server"` file exports a value that is not an async function. It might happen when you unintentionally export something like a configuration object, an arbitrary value, or missed the `async` keyword in the exported function declaration.

These functions are required to be defined as async, because `"use server"` marks them as [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) and they can be invoked directly from the client through a network request.

Examples of incorrect code:

```js
'use server'

// ❌ This is incorrect: only async functions are allowed.
export const value = 1

// ❌ This is incorrect: missed the `async` keyword.
export function getServerData() {
  return '...'
}
```

Correct code:

```js
'use server'

// ✅ This is correct: an async function is exported.
export async function getServerData() {
  return '...'
}
```

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Check all exported values in the `"use server"` file (including `export *`) and make sure that they are all defined as async functions.
