title: '`next.config.js` Loading Error'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When attempting to load your `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs` file, an error occurred. This could be due to a syntax error or attempting to `require`/`import` a module that wasn't available.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

See the error message in your terminal where you started `next` to see more context.

> Note: This config file is not transpiled by Next.js, so only use features supported by your current Node.js version.
