title: No img element

> Prevent usage of `<img>` element due to slower LCP and higher bandwidth.

## Why This Error Occurred

An `<img>` element was used to display an image instead of `<Image />` from `next/image`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

1. Use [`next/image`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) to improve performance with automatic [Image Optimization](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image).

> **Note**: If deploying to a [managed hosting provider](/docs/pages/getting-started/deploying), remember to check provider pricing since optimized images might be charged differently than the original images.
>
> Common image optimization platform pricing:
>
> - [Vercel pricing](https://vercel.com/pricing)
> - [Cloudinary pricing](https://cloudinary.com/pricing)
> - [imgix pricing](https://imgix.com/pricing)

> **Note**: If self-hosting, remember to install [`sharp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and check if your server has enough storage to cache the optimized images.

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Image from 'next/image'

function Home() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://example.com/hero.jpg"
      alt="Landscape picture"
      width={800}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}

export default Home
```

2. If you would like to use `next/image` features such as blur-up placeholders but disable Image Optimization, you can do so using [unoptimized](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized):

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Image from 'next/image'

const UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {
  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />
}
```

3. You can also use the `<picture>` element with the nested `<img>` element:

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
function Home() {
  return (
    <picture>
      <source srcSet="https://example.com/hero.avif" type="image/avif" />
      <source srcSet="https://example.com/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <img
        src="https://example.com/hero.jpg"
        alt="Landscape picture"
        width={800}
        height={500}
      />
    </picture>
  )
}
```

4. You can use a [custom image loader](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader) to optimize images. Set [loaderFile](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loaderfile) to the path of your custom loader.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  images: {
    loader: 'custom',
    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',
  },
}
```
