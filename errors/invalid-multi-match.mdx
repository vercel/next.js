title: Invalid Multi-match
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In one of your custom-routes you specified a multi-match `/:path*` and used it in your `destination` without adding the `*` in your `destination` e.g. `destination: '/another/:path'`

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Add `*` to your usage of the multi-match param in your `destination`.

**Before**

```js
{
  source: '/:path*',
  destination: '/another/:path'
}
```

**After**

```js
{
  source: '/:path*',
  destination: '/another/:path*'
}
```
