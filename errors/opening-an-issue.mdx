#### Why This Message Occurred

When `next info` was run, Next.js detected that it was not on the newest canary release.

`next@canary` is the canary version of Next.js that ships daily. It includes all features and fixes that have not been released to the stable version yet. Think of canary as a public beta.

Some issues may already be fixed in the canary version, so please verify that your issue reproduces before opening a new issue.

Run the following in the codebase:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@canary
```

or

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add next@canary
```

And go through the prepared reproduction steps once again, and check if the issue still exists.
