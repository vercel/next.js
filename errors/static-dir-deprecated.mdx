title: Static directory is deprecated
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In versions prior to 9.0.6 the `static` directory was used to serve static assets in a Next.js application. This has been deprecated in favor of a `public` directory.

The reason we want to support a `public` directory instead is to not require the `/static` prefix for assets anymore and there is no reason to maintain both paths.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

You can move your `static` directory inside of the `public` directory and all URLs will stay the same as they were before.

**Before**

```txt
  .
  ├── pages/
  │   └── index.js
  └── static/
      └── my-image.jpg
```

**After**

```txt
  .
  ├── pages/
  │   └── index.js
  └── public/
      └── static/
          └── my-image.jpg
```
