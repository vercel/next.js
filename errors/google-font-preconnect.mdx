title: Google Font Preconnect
---

> **Note**: Next.js automatically adds `<link rel="preconnect" />` after version `12.0.1`.

> Ensure `preconnect` is used with Google Fonts.

## Why This Error Occurred

A preconnect resource hint was not used with a request to the Google Fonts domain. Adding `preconnect` is recommended to initiate an early connection to the origin.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Add `rel="preconnect"` to the Google Font domain `<link>` tag:

```jsx filename="pages/_document.js"
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
```

> **Note**: a **separate** link with `dns-prefetch` can be used as a fallback for browsers that don't support `preconnect` although this is not required.
