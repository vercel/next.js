## Why This Error Occurred

In the error overlay, a message was shown that the detected Next.js version was out-of-date.

To get the newest features and bug fixes, it is recommended to stay up to date.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

If you are testing out a canary release, upgrade Next.js with one of the following:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@canary
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add next@canary
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm add next@canary
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun add next@canary
```

If you are using a stable release, upgrade Next.js with one of the following:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@latest
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add next@latest
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm add next@latest
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun add next@latest
```

If you are coming from an older major version, check out our [upgrade guides](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading).

### Note

If you want to report a bug on GitHub, you should upgrade to the newest canary release of Next.js first, to see if the bug has already been fixed in canary.
