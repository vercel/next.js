# `redirect` and `gone` cannot both be returned

## Why This Error Occurred

In a page's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, you attempted to return both the `redirect` property and the `gone` property. These properties are mutually exclusiveâ€”you can only return one of them at a time.

```js
// This will cause an error
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    redirect: {
      destination: '/',
      permanent: false,
    },
    gone: true,
  }
}
```

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Decide whether you want to redirect the user to a different page (`redirect`) or show a 410 Gone error page (`gone`):

### If you want to redirect:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    redirect: {
      destination: '/',
      permanent: false,
    },
  }
}
```

### If you want to show a 410 Gone error page:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    gone: true,
  }
}
```

Remember that:

- `redirect` is used to send users to a different page
- `gone` is used to show a 410 Gone error page for content that has been permanently removed
- You cannot use both at the same time
