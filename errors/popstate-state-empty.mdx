title: '`popstate` called with empty state'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When using the browser back button the popstate event is triggered. Next.js sees a
`popstate` event being triggered but `event.state` did not have `url` or `as`, causing a route change failure.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

The only known cause of this issue is manually manipulating `window.history` instead of using `next/router`. Starting from version 9.5, Next.js will ignore `popstate` events that contain `event.state` not created by its own router.
