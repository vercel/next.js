title: 'SSG `fallback: true` Export Error'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

You attempted to export a page with a `fallback: true` return value from `getStaticPaths` which is invalid. `fallback: true` is meant for building pages on-demand after a build has occurred, exporting disables this functionality

## Possible Ways to Fix It

If you would like the `fallback: true` behavior, you must remove `output: 'export'` and remove `next export` in favor of a different [deployment solution](/docs/pages/getting-started/deploying).
