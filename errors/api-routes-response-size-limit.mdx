## Why This Error Occurred

The "API Routes Response Size Limited to 4MB" error arises when your API Route is trying to send a response larger than the allowed size of `4MB`. API Routes in Next.js are designed to deliver quick responses and are not built to support the transmission of large amounts of data.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

If you are not utilizing Next.js in a serverless environment, and you're fully aware of the performance implications, you can disable this limit in your API Route. Here is how you can set `responseLimit` to `false`:

```js filename="pages/api/example.js"
export const config = {
  api: {
    responseLimit: false,
  },
}
```

Alternatively, `responseLimit` can also accept a numeric value (in bytes) or any string format supported by the `bytes` module. This can be a value like `1000`, `'500kb'`, or `'3mb'`. This value will set the maximum response size before a warning is displayed. For example, to set the limit to 8MB:

```js filename="pages/api/example.js"
export const config = {
  api: {
    responseLimit: '8mb',
  },
}
```

> **Note**: Increasing the response limit can have significant impacts on performance and should only be done after careful consideration.
