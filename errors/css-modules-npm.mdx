title: CSS Modules Imported by a Dependency
---

## Why This Error Occurred

One of your dependencies (`node_modules`) imports a CSS Modules file.

This normally happens when a package's source files are accidentally consumed,
instead of the built package.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Reach out to the maintainer and ask for them to publish a compiled version of
their dependency.

Compiled dependencies do not have references to CSS Module files, or any other
files that require bundler-specific integrations.

The dependency should also provide instructions about what CSS needs to be
imported by you, in your application.

If this is **first-party code**, try [including monorepo packages in the compilation pipeline](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#module-transpilation).

> **Good to know**: This limitation does not exist when using the App Router.
