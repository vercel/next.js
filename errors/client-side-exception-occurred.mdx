title: Client-side Exception Occurred
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In your production application a client-side error occurred that was not caught by an error boundary. Additional information should be visible in the console tab of your browser.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Add error boundaries in your React tree to gracefully handle client-side errors and render a fallback view when they occur.
