title: 'Invalid Usage of `suspense` Option of `next/dynamic`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

- You are using `{ suspense: true }` with React version older than 18.
- You are using `{ suspense: true, ssr: false }`.
- You are using `{ suspense: true, loading }`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

**If you are using `{ suspense: true }` with React version older than 18**

- You can try upgrading to React 18 or newer
- If upgrading React is not an option, remove `{ suspense: true }` from `next/dynamic` usages.

**If you are using `{ suspense: true, ssr: false }`**

Next.js will use `React.lazy` when `suspense` is set to true. React 18 or newer will always try to resolve the Suspense boundary on the server. This behavior can not be disabled, thus the `ssr: false` is ignored with `suspense: true`.

- You should write code that works in both client-side and server-side.
- If rewriting the code is not an option, remove `{ suspense: true }` from `next/dynamic` usages.

**If you are using `{ suspense: true, loading }`**

Next.js will use `React.lazy` when `suspense` is set to true, when your dynamic-imported component is loading, React will use the closest suspense boundary's fallback.

You should remove `loading` from `next/dynamic` usages, and use `<Suspense />`'s `fallback` prop.
