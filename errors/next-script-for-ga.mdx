title: Using Google Analytics with Next.js (through `next/script`)
---

> Prefer `next/script` component when using the inline script for Google Analytics.

## Why This Error Occurred

An inline script was used for Google Analytics which might impact your webpage's performance. Instead, we recommend using `next/script` through the `@next/third-parties` library.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

### Use `@next/third-parties` to add Google Analytics

**`@next/third-parties`** is a library that provides a collection of components and utilities that improve the performance and developer experience of loading popular third-party libraries in your Next.js application. It is available with Next.js 14 (install `next@latest`).

The `GoogleAnalytics` component can be used to include [Google Analytics
4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) to your page via the Google tag (`gtag.js`). By default, it fetches the original scripts after hydration occurs on the page.

> **Recommendation**: If Google Tag Manager is already included in your application, you can
> configure Google Analytics directly using it, rather than including Google Analytics as a separate component. Refer to the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/tag-options#what-is-gtm)
> to learn more about the differences between Tag Manager and `gtag.js`.

To load Google Analytics for all routes, include the component directly in your root layout and pass in your measurement ID:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
      <GoogleAnalytics gaId="G-XYZ" />
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
      <GoogleAnalytics gaId="G-XYZ" />
    </html>
  )
}
```

To load Google Analytics for a single route, include the component in your page file:

```jsx filename="app/page.js"
import { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return <GoogleAnalytics gaId="G-XYZ" />
}
```

> **Good to know:**
>
> - If you are using the Pages Router, please refer to the [`pages/` documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries).
> - `@next/third-parties` also supports [Google Tag Manager](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-tag-manager) and other third parties.
> - Using `@next/third-parties` is not required. You can also use the `next/script` component directly. Refer to the [`next/script` documentation](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) to learn more.
