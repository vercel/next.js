## Why This Error Occurred

The "Built-in CSS Support Disabled" error typically occurs when a custom CSS configuration is added in the `next.config.js` file. This action deactivates the built-in CSS/SCSS support to avoid conflicts in configuration.

If you have added a legacy plugin like `@zeit/next-css` in your `next.config.js` file, you may encounter this error message.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

If you want to use the built-in CSS/SCSS support, you need to remove any custom CSS configuration or plugins such as `@zeit/next-css` or `@zeit/next-sass` in your `next.config.js` file. We recommend this approach.

On the other hand, if you choose not to use the built-in support, you can safely ignore this warning.
