## Why This Error Occurred

The "Babel and `next/font` Conflict" error arises when you attempt to use `next/font` in conjunction with a custom Babel configuration in your Next.js application. When you have a custom Babel config, you opt out of the Next.js Compiler, which is a requirement for using `next/font`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To address this issue, you should remove your custom Babel configuration (e.g. `.babelrc`) and instead make use of the Next.js Compiler. This ensures compatibility between your Babel configuration and `next/font`.
