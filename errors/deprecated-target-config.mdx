title: Deprecated target config

## Why This Error Occurred

Starting in Next.js 13, the `target` property in `next.config.js` has been removed.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

For serverless targets, please use the Output File Tracing or deploy your application somewhere where it can be leveraged automatically, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
