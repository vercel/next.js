## Why This Error Occurred

The "`app/` Static to Dynamic Error" happens when one of your routes in the `app/` directory is initially generated statically at build time, but during runtime it attempts to use dynamic server values (such as `cookies` or `headers`) either for a fallback path or while a path is being revalidated.

Currently, Next.js does not support switching between static and dynamic types during runtime, so the system throws an error.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To resolve this issue, you have two main options:

1. Prevent the conditional use of dynamic server values that may cause the static/dynamic mode of the page to differ between build time and runtime. This ensures consistency in the rendering mode of your page.

2. Leverage the `dynamic` export to control the handling of your page. If you want to ensure your page is always handled statically, regardless of the usage of dynamic server values, you can use `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`. Conversely, if you prefer your page to always be dynamic, you can use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, and your page won't attempt to be statically generated.
