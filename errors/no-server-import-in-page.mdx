> Prevent usage of `next/server` outside of `middleware.js`.

## Why This Error Occurred

`next/server` was imported outside of `middleware.{js,ts}`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Only import and use `next/server` in a file located within the project root directory: `middleware.{js,ts}`.

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req: NextRequest, ev: NextFetchEvent) {
  return new Response('Hello, world!')
}
```
