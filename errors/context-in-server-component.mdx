title: createContext in a Server Component
---

## Why This Error Occurred

You are using `createContext` in a Server Component but it only works in Client Components.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Mark the component using `createContext` as a Client Component by adding `'use client'` at the top of the file.

### Before

```jsx filename="app/example-component.js"
import { createContext } from 'react'

const Context = createContext()
```

### After

```jsx filename="app/example-component.js"
'use client'
import { createContext } from 'react'

const Context = createContext()
```
