title: Invalid External Rewrite
---

## Why This Error Occurred

A rewrite was defined with both `basePath: false` and an internal `destination`. Rewrites that capture urls outside of the `basePath` must route externally, as they are intended for proxying in the case of incremental adoption of Next.js in a project.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Look for any rewrite where `basePath` is `false` and make sure its `destination` starts with `http://` or `https://`.
