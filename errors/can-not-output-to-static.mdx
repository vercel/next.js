title: Cannot output to /static
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Either you set `distDir` to `static` in your `next.config.js` or during `next export` you tried to export to the `static` directory.

This is not allowed because `static` is used by Next.js to serve static assets.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Use a different `distDir` or export to a different folder.
