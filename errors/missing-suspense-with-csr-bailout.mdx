title: Missing Suspense boundary with useSearchParams
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Reading search parameters through `useSearchParams()` without a Suspense boundary will opt the entire page into client-side rendering. This could cause your page to be blank until the client-side JavaScript has loaded.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Ensure that calls to `useSearchParams()` are wrapped in a Suspense boundary.

```tsx filename="app/search.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  return <input placeholder="Search..." />
}

export function Searchbar() {
  return (
    // You could have a loading skeleton as the `fallback` too
    <Suspense>
      <Search />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/search.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  return <input placeholder="Search..." />
}

export function Searchbar() {
  return (
    // You could have a loading skeleton as the `fallback` too
    <Suspense>
      <Search />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

This will ensure the page does not de-opt to client-side rendering.

## Disabling

> **Note**: This is only available with Next.js version 14.x. If you're in versions above 14 please fix it with the approach above.

We don't recommend disabling this rule. However, if you need to, you can disable it by setting the `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout` option to `false` in your `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout: false,
  },
}
```

This configuration option will be removed in a future major version.
