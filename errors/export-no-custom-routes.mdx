## Why This Error Occurred

In your `next.config.js` you defined `rewrites`, `redirects`, or `headers` along with `output: 'export'` (or you ran `next export`).

These configs do not apply when exporting your Next.js application manually.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Remove `rewrites`, `redirects`, and `headers` from your `next.config.js` to disable these features or
- Remove `output: 'export'` (or `next export`) in favor of [`next start`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#production) to run a production server
