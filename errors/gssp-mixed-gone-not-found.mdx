# `notFound` and `gone` cannot both be returned

## Why This Error Occurred

In a page's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, you attempted to return both the `notFound` property and the `gone` property. These properties are mutually exclusiveâ€”you can only return one of them at a time.

```js
// This will cause an error
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    notFound: true,
    gone: true,
  }
}
```

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Decide whether you want to show a 404 Not Found error page (`notFound`) or a 410 Gone error page (`gone`):

### If the content cannot be found but might exist in the future:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    notFound: true,
  }
}
```

### If the content has been deliberately and permanently removed:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    gone: true,
  }
}
```

Remember that:

- `notFound` (404) is used when content cannot be found but might exist in the future
- `gone` (410) is used when content has been permanently removed and will not be available again
- You cannot use both at the same time
