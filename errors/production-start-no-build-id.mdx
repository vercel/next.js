title: Could not find a production build
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When running `next start` or a custom server in production mode a production build is needed.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Run `next build` to create a production build before booting up the production server.
- If your intention was to run the development server run `next dev` instead.
