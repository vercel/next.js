title: No Script Tags In Head Component
---

## Why This Error Occurred

A `<script>` tag was added using the `next/head` component.

For the best performance, we recommend using `next/script`. Using `next/script` also ensures compatibility with React Suspense and streaming server-rendering.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

### Script Component

The **Script component**, [`next/script`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script), allows you to optimally load third-party scripts anywhere in your Next.js application. It is an extension of the HTML `<script>` element and enables you to choose between multiple loading strategies to fit your use case.

```jsx filename="pages/dashboard.js"
import Script from 'next/script'

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script src="https://example.com/script.js" />
    </>
  )
}
```
