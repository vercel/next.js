title: 'Missing `width` in the URL Returned by the Loader Prop on `next/image`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

The [`loader`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader) prop on the `next/image` component allows you to override the built-in URL resolution with a custom implementation in order to support any 3rd party cloud provider that can perform Image Optimization.

This error occurred because the provided `loader()` function did not use `width` in the returned URL string. This means that the image will likely not be resized and therefore degrade performance.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Ensure your Image Optimization provider can resize images. Then use the `width` parameter from the [`loader()`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader) function to construct the correct URL string.
- Add the [`unoptimized`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) prop.
