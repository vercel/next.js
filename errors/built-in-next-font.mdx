title: Resolving "Built-in next/font" Error in Next.js
description: This document offers a detailed guide on fixing the "Built-in `next/font`" error in Next.js, which typically occurs when you're still using the `@next/font` package in Next.js 13.2 and later.
---

`next/font` will automatically optimize your fonts (including custom fonts) and remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance.

## Why This Error Occurred

The "Built-in `next/font`" error is triggered when the `@next/font` package is still installed and used in your Next.js application.

From version 13.2 onward, **`next/font` has been built into Next.js**, making the `@next/font` package redundant. The `@next/font` package will be completely removed in Next.js 14.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To resolve this issue, you need to uninstall `@next/font` and replace all `@next/font` imports with `next/font` in your project. This can be done automatically using the `built-in-next-font` codemod:

```sh filename="Terminal"
npx @next/codemod built-in-next-font .
```
