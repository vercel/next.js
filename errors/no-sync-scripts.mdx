> Prevent synchronous scripts.

## Why This Error Occurred

A synchronous script was used which can impact your webpage performance.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

### Script component (recommended)

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Script from 'next/script'

function Home() {
  return (
    <div class="container">
      <Script src="https://third-party-script.js"></Script>
      <div>Home Page</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

### Use `async` or `defer`

```html
<script src="https://third-party-script.js" async />
<script src="https://third-party-script.js" defer />
```
