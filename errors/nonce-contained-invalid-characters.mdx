title: nonce contained invalid characters
---

## Why This Error Occurred

A request to your Next.js application contained a `Content-Security-Policy`
header with a `script-src` directive and `nonce` that contains
invalid characters (any one of `<>&` characters). For example:

- `'nonce-<script />'`: not allowed
- `'nonce-/>script<>'`: not allowed
- `'nonce-PHNjcmlwdCAvPg=='`: allowed
- `'nonce-Lz5zY3JpcHQ8Pg=='`: allowed

## Possible Ways to Fix It

We recommend using a randomly generated UUID for your nonce.

Learn more about how to use nonces with Next.js in our [Content Security Policy](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) docs.
