title: '`NextResponse.next()` used in a Route Handler in the App Router'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Route Handlers in the Next.js App Router do not support using the `NextResponse.next()` method to forward to the next Middleware.

The Route Handler is considered the end of the middleware "chain". Handlers must always return a `Response` object instead.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Remove the `NextResponse.next()` and replace it with a correct response handler.
