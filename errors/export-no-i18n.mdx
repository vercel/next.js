title: Export Internationalization (i18n)
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In your `next.config.js` you defined `i18n`, along with `output: 'export'` (or you ran `next export`).

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Remove `i18n` from your `next.config.js` to disable Internationalization or
- Remove `output: 'export'` (or `next export`) in favor of [`next start`](/docs/pages/api-reference/cli/next#next-start-options) to run a production server
