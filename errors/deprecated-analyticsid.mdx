title: config.analytics is deprecated

## Why This Error Occurred

The Core Web Vitals of your Next.js application could be tracked and sent to any backend of your choice.

Earlier version of Next.js enable tracking by specifying `analyticsId` into your `next.config.js` file.

This configuration mechanism will be removed in nextjs@15, as it could be elegantly replaced with `useReportWebVitals` built-in hook.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To remove this warning, you must remove `analyticsId` from your `next.config.js` file.

To keep tracking your Core Web Vitals, you could:

- use `useReportWebVitals` hook as explained [here](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) and send the metrics to any backend of your choice.
- [install and use](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) `@vercel/speed-insights` package into your application
