title: Fast Refresh had to perform full reload
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload when you edited a file. It may be because:

- The file you're editing might have other exports in addition to a React component.
- Your React component is an anonymous function.
- The component name is in camelCase and not PascalCase, for example `textField` instead of `TextField`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Move your other exports to a separate file.
- Use a named function for your React component.
- Rename your component name to pascal case.
