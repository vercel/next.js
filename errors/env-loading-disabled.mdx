title: Env Loading Disabled
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In your project you have `dotenv` listed as a `dependency` or a `devDependency` which opts-out of Next.js' automatic loading to prevent creating a conflict with any existing `dotenv` behavior in your project.

This is also disabled if a `package.json` isn't able to found in your project somehow.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Update to the latest version of Next.js (>= v9.4.1) where this support is enabled regardless of `dotenv` being installed.

Remove `dotenv` from your `devDependencies` or `dependencies` and allow Next.js to load your `dotenv` files for you.
