title: Page Without Valid React Component
---

## Why This Error Occurred

A page that does not export a valid React Component was found while analyzing the build output.

This is a hard error because the page would error when rendered, and causes poor build performance.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Investigate the list of page(s) specified in the error message.
For each, you'll want to check if the file is meant to be a page.

If the file is not meant to be a page, and instead, is a shared component or file, move the file to a different folder like `components` or `lib`.

If the file is meant to be a page, double check you have an `export default` with the React Component instead of an `export`. If you're already using `export default`, make sure the returned value is a valid React Component.

If you need to support a different file extension for a page component (such as `.mdx`) or would like to include non-page files in the `pages` directory, configure [Custom Page Extensions](/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/pageExtensions) in the `next.config.js`.
