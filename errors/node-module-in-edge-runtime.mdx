title: Using Node.js Modules in Edge Runtime
---

## Why This Error Occurred

The code in your [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) or your [Edge API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) is using a feature from Node.js runtime.

However, the Edge Runtime does not support [Node.js APIs and globals](/docs/pages/api-reference/edge#unsupported-apis).

## Possible Ways to Fix It

When running Next.js locally with `next dev`, your application will show in the console, and in your browser, which file is importing and using an unsupported module. This module must be avoided: either by not importing it, or by replacing it with a polyfill.

For example, you might replace the Node.js `crypto` module with the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
