title: '`next/image` changed in version 13'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Starting in Next.js 13, the `next/image` component has undergone some major changes.

Compared to the legacy component, the new `next/image` component has the following changes:

- Removes `<span>` wrapper around `<img>` in favor of [native computed aspect ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_img_aspect_ratio_computed_from_attributes)
- Adds support for canonical `style` prop
  - Removes `layout` prop in favor of `style` or `className`
  - Removes `objectFit` prop in favor of `style` or `className`
  - Removes `objectPosition` prop in favor of `style` or `className`
- Removes `IntersectionObserver` implementation in favor of [native lazy loading](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr)
  - Removes `lazyBoundary` prop since there is no native equivalent
  - Removes `lazyRoot` prop since there is no native equivalent
- Removes `loader` config in favor of [`loader`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loader) prop
- Changed `alt` prop from optional to required

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Run the [next-image-to-legacy-image](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image) codemod to automatically change `next/image` imports to `next/legacy/image`, for example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx @next/codemod next-image-to-legacy-image .
```

After running this codemod, you can optionally upgrade `next/legacy/image` to the new `next/image` with another codemod, for example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx @next/codemod next-image-experimental .
```

Please note this second codemod is experimental and only covers static usage (such as `<Image src={img} layout="responsive" />`) but not dynamic usage (such as `<Image {...props} />`).
