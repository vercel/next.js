title: 'Invalid `next` Import'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Somewhere in your application, you imported `next` directly which is only meant to be used with legacy custom servers.

You should not import `next` inside of pages or components.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Ensure any usage of `import next from "next"` is specific to custom server usage and isn't included in your pages or components.

Also ensure any type imports are kept inside of TypeScript files e.g. ensure `import { PageConfig } from 'next'` isn't used in JavaScript files.
