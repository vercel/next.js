# Triaging

Repository maintainers triage every issue and PR opened in the repository.

> Note: Feature requests should be opened as discussions, filling out [this template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas).

Issues are opened with one of these labels:

- `bug` - issue with Next.js itself
- `documentation` - feedback for improvement or an issue with the Next.js documentation
- `examples` - an issue with one of the examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) folder

## Bug reports

### Automated triaging

In case of a bug report, **if the reproduction is missing or insufficient, the issue is automatically closed**, and a comment is added with a correct course of action. The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/invalid-link.md). We also add an `invalid link` label to mark the issue. To avoid your issue being closed, please follow the [bug report template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1.bug_report.yml) carefully.

If you fill out the "Which area(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)" section of the bug report template, we will add the corresponding [label(s)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/labels).

### Manual triaging

If the issue is specific to the project and not to Next.js itself, it will be converted to a [üéìÔ∏è Help discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/categories/help)

A maintainer can also manually label an issue with one of the following labels, which will also add a comment with a correct course of action:

1. `please add a complete reproduction`

The provided reproduction is not enough for the maintainers to investigate. If sufficient reproduction is not provided for more than 30 days, the issue becomes stale and will be automatically closed. If a reproduction is provided within 30 days, a `needs triage` label is added, indicating that the issue needs another look from a maintainer.

The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/invalid-reproduction.md)

2. `please verify canary`

The issue is not verified against the `next@canary` release. The canary version of Next.js ships daily and includes all features and fixes that have not been released to the stable version yet. Think of canary as a public beta. Some issues may already be fixed in the canary version, so please verify that your issue reproduces before opening a new issue. Issues not verified against `next@canary` will be closed after 30 days.

The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/verify-canary.md)

3. `please simplify reproduction`

The provided reproduction is too complex or requires too many steps to reproduce. If a simplified reproduction is not provided for more than 30 days, the issue becomes stale and will be automatically closed. If a reproduction is provided within 30 days, a `needs triage` label is added, indicating that the issue needs another look from a maintainer.
The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/simplify-reproduction.md)

4. `good first issue`

The issue is considered beginner-friendly enough to be a good starting point for someone new to the project who wants to contribute.
The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/good-first-issue.md)

5. `resolved`

We assume that a newer version of Next.js fixed the issue. If the issue is still relevant, please open a new issue and reference the old one.
The issue will receive [this comment](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/.github/comments/resolved.md)

## Verified issues

If an issue is verified, it will receive the `linear: next`, `linear: dx` or `linear: web` label and will be tracked by the maintainers. Additionally, one or more [label(s)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/labels) can be added to indicate which part of Next.js is affected.

Confirmed issues never become stale or are closed before resolution.

## Closed issues

All **closed** PRs and Issues will be locked after 2 weeks of inactivity (eg.: comment, referencing from elsewhere). If you think the issue is still relevant, please open a new issue and reference the old one.
