# Create Next App

The easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples). To get started, use the following command:

### Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
# or
bunx create-next-app
```

You will be asked for the name of your project, and then whether you want to
create a TypeScript project:

```bash
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
```

Select **Yes** to install the necessary types/dependencies and create a new TS project.

### Non-interactive

You can pass options with `--yes` to create a project without prompts. For example:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --yes
```

Run `npx create-next-app@latest --help` for the current options, or see the
[CLI reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Why use Create Next App?

`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:

- **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app@latest` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.
- **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.
- **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example route-handlers`).
- **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.
