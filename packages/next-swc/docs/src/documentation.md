# Writing documentation for Turbopack

Turbopack has two main types of documentation. One is a description of the code and APIs, and the other is a high-level description of the overall behavior. Since there is no [way](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66249) to integrate with rustdoc yet, we deploy mdbook and rustdoc together with a script.

## Write a general overview document

Files written in markdown format in `packages/next-swc/docs/src` can be read by [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).(Like the page you're looking at now)

## Write a rustdoc comment

If you write a [documentation comment](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/comments.html) in your code, it will be included in the documentation generated by rustdoc. The full index can be found [here](https://turbopack-rust-docs.vercel.sh/rustdoc/index.html), and individual packages can be read via `https://turbopack-rust-docs.vercel.sh/rustdoc/${pkg_name}/index.html`.

## Build the documentation

The `scripts/deploy-turbopack-docs.sh` script bundles the mdbook and rustdoc and deploys them. You can use it locally as a build script because it won't run the deployment if it doesn't have a token. The script runs a rustdoc build followed by an mdbook build, and then copies the output of the rustdoc build under `mdbook/rustdoc`.
