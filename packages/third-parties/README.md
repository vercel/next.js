# Experimental `@next/third-parties`

`@next/third-parties` is a collection of components and utilities that can be used to efficiently load third-party libraries into your Next.js application.

> Note: `@next/third-parties` is still experimental and under active development.

# Usage

## Google Third-Parties

### YouTube Embed

The `YouTubeEmbed` component is used to load and display a YouTube embed. This component loads faster by using [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) under the hood.

```js
import { YouTubeEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return <YouTubeEmbed videoid="ogfYd705cRs" height={400} />
}
```

> **Note:** The `autoplay=1` parameter does not work. This is due to browser restrictions that require videos to be muted before autoplay is allowed. Currently, [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) does not support setting the muted state. See [this issue](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed/issues/139) for more details.

### Google Maps Embed

The `GoogleMapsEmbed` component can be used to add a [Google Maps Embed](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started) to your page. By default, it uses the `loading` attribute to lazy-load below the fold.

```js
import { GoogleMapsEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <GoogleMapsEmbed
      apiKey="XYZ"
      height={200}
      width="100%"
      mode="place"
      q="Brooklyn+Bridge,New+York,NY"
    />
  )
}
```

To get a better idea of how these components work, take a look at this [demo](https://test-next-script-housseindjirdeh.vercel.app/). <!--- TODO: Replace with a better demo page -->
