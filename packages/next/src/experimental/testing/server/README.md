# next/experimental/testing/server

This directory contains helpers for unit testing Next.js server code, such as
routing using `next.config.js` or `middleware`. These utilities can be used to
verify the behavior of redirects, rewrites, adding headers, or middleware logic
before code reaches to production.

See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware
and https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js for more details.
