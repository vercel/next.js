/**
 * Entry point to the Segment Cache implementation.
 *
 * All code related to the Segment Cache lives `segment-cache-impl` directory.
 * Callers access it through this indirection.
 *
 * This is to ensure the code is dead code eliminated from the bundle if the
 * flag is disabled.
 *
 * TODO: This is super tedious. Since experimental flags are an essential part
 * of our workflow, we should establish a better pattern for dead code
 * elimination. Ideally it would be done at the bundler level, like how React's
 * build process works. In the React repo, you don't even need to add any extra
 * configuration per experiment â€” if the code is not reachable, it gets stripped
 * from the build automatically by Rollup. Or, shorter term, we could stub out
 * experimental modules at build time by updating the build config, i.e. a more
 * automated version of what I'm doing manually in this file.
