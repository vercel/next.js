# Dev Overlay

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Main entrypoint and related files for App Router dev overlay.
- `font/` - Includes Geist fonts that will be served to the client via the internal `/__nextjs_font/...` route.
- `pages/` - Main entrypoint and related files for Pages Router dev overlay.
- `server/` - Source files related to the dev overlay that are to run on the server and not sent to the client.
- `ui/` - Main source files that build the UI of the dev overlay. It is recommended to keep this directory isolated from the rest of the codebase to make it easier to be excluded from compiliation and be bundled in the future.
- `utils/` - Utils that can also be used outside of this project unlike the ones inside the `ui/` directory.

## Development

The dev overlay leverages [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) to insert the dev overlay into the client without affecting the user's application through encapsulation from CSS.

### Local Development

Next.js uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to develop UI components in the dev overlay.

To run the dev overlay locally, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server at `http://localhost:6006`.

### Styling

Next.js direcly injects CSS into the DOM via `<style>` tag. The styles will not affect the user's application as the [styles are encapsulated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM#encapsulation_from_css) from the rest of the application.

> [!TIP]
> While Shadow DOM provides style encapsulation, the root element (i.e., `<nextjs-portal>`) can still inherit styles from parent elements like `<body>` or `<html>`. Direct styling on these parent elements (e.g., `body { contain: layout; }`) will affect the dev overlay.

Write CSS in template literals alongside your components. It is recommended to use the class names that are unique within the dev overlay to avoid conflicts. You can use `data-nextjs-` data attributes to target the elements in the dev overlay.

```tsx
export function Component() {
  return (
    <div className="some-unique-class-name">
      <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export const COMPONENT_NAME_STYLES = `
  .some-unique-class-name {
    background-color: red;
  }
`
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the `css()` util that minifies and removes the comments before injecting to the `<style>` tag.

The exported `COMPONENT_NAME_STYLES` can be used in the styles entrypoint (i.e., `ComponentStyles`) of the dev overlay to inject into the `<style>` tag.

```tsx
import { COMPONENT_NAME_STYLES } from './component'

export function ComponentStyles() {
  return (
    <style>
      {css`
        // ...
        ${COMPONENT_NAME_STYLES}
      `}
    </style
  )
}
```
