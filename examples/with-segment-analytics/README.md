# Example app with analytics

This example shows how to use Next.js along with [Segment Analytics](https://segment.com). A custom document is used in inject the [Segment snippet](https://github.com/segmentio/snippet) into the `<head>`. Page views are tracked on both the server and client side and components fire ["track"](https://segment.com/docs/spec/track/) events based on user actions (see `contact.js` for example).
