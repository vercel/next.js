# API routes with GraphQL server

Next.js ships with [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), which provide an easy solution to build your own `API`.
This example showcases how to build a lightweight and blazing fast GraphQL API with minimum configuration using GraphQL Yoga.

GraphQL Yoga comes with strong defaults:

- CORS is enabled by default
- Automatically masking unexpected errors and preventing sensitive information from leaking to clients.
- Shipped with GraphiQL

Yoga also brings support (with no additional dependency) for subscriptions, file uploads, and your favorite schema-building library (GraphQL Tools, Pothos, Nexus, TypeGraphQL, SDL first schema-design approaches, graphql-js, Apollo Tools).

More information on all available features are available [on the official documentation](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/quick-start).

Finally, GraphQL Yoga is built on top of Envelop. Envelop is a library that helps build GraphQL API faster and flexibly with plugin-based architecture.

Similar to Express middlewares allowing you to customize requests' behavior, Envelop applies the same idea to GraphQL requests.
