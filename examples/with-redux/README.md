# Redux Toolkit TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

**Redux Toolkit**(also known as "RTK" for short) provides a standardized way to write Redux logic. It includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including [store setup](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore), [creating reducers and writing immutable update logic](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer), and even [creating entire "slices" of state at once](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice). This example showcases each of these features in conjunction with Next.js.

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```
