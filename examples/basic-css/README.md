cd basic-css
```

or clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/zeit/next.js.git --depth=1
cd next.js/examples/basic-css
```

## The idea behind the example

Next.js ships with [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) allowing you
to write scope styled components with full css support. This is important for
the modularity and code size of your bundles and also for the learning curve of the framework. If you know css you can write styled-jsx right away.
