# TypeScript Next.js example

This examples is part of the `create-next-app` CLI as an official TypeScript template and can be used with the `--ts` or `--typescript` flag.

## Notes

This example shows how to integrate the TypeScript type system into Next.js. Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript. (Installing this template will do this for you)

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript
# or
yarn add --dev typescript
```

To enable TypeScript's features, we install the type declarations for React and Node.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
# or
yarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it. It even automatically creates/updates a `tsconfig.json` file for our project with the recommended settings.

Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.

A `type-check` script is also added to `package.json`, which runs TypeScript's `tsc` CLI in `noEmit` mode to run type-checking separately. You can then include this, for example, in your `test` scripts.
