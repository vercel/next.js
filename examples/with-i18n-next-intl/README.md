# next-intl example

This example uses [next-intl](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl), a minimal, but complete solution for managing internationalization in Next.js apps.

## Features

- üåü I18n is an essential part of the user experience, therefore this library doesn't compromise on flexibility and never leaves you behind when you need to fine tune a translation. Messages use the proven [ICU syntax](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax) which covers interpolation, numbers, dates, times, plurals, ordinal pluralization, label selection based on enums and rich text.
- ‚öîÔ∏è Based on battle-tested building blocks from [Format.JS](https://formatjs.io/) (used by `react-intl`), this library is a thin wrapper around high-quality, lower-level APIs for i18n.
- üíØ Built-in number and date formatting that is integrated with translations, e.g. allowing for the usage of global formats for a consistent look & feel of your app.
- üí° A hooks-only API ensures that you can use the same API for `children` as well as for attributes which expect strings.
- üöÄ Integrates with both static as well as server side rendering.
