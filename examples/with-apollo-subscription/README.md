# Apollo With Subscription Example

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/client/) is a GraphQL client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a GraphQL server. In addition to fetching and mutating data, Apollo analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations are run, fetching more results from the server.

In this simple example, we integrate Apollo seamlessly with Next by wrapping our `pages/index.js` inside a [higher-order component (HOC)](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html). Using the HOC pattern we're able to pass down a central store of query result data created by Apollo into our React component hierarchy defined inside each page of our Next application.

On initial page load, while on the server and inside `getInitialProps`, we invoke the Apollo method, [`getDataFromTree`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-ssr/#getdatafromtree). This method returns a promise; at the point in which the promise resolves, our Apollo Client store is completely initialized.

## In addition to this, we configure our apollo client to work with subscription on the client-side and ensures that only subscription operations are made through websockets.

To see a working example of this, navigate to the Subscription-example page and open up the url in two browsers. Submit a link in the first browser and check the other browser, you'd see the newly submitted link show up instantly without your need to refresh the page.

This example relies on [graph.cool](https://www.graph.cool) for its GraphQL backend.

Note: Do not be alarmed that you see two renders being executed. Apollo recursively traverses the React render tree looking for Apollo query components. When it has done that, it fetches all these queries and then passes the result to a cache. This cache is then used to render the data on the server side (another React render).

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npm init next-app --example with-apollo-subscription with-apollo-subscription-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-apollo-subscription with-apollo-subscription-app
```

### Download manually

Download the example:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/with-apollo-subscription
cd with-apollo-subscription
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```
