# React-GA4 example

As of May 2023, [react-ga](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga/issues/541) uses Universal Analytics which will stop processing new data starting July 2023. Until this is fixed, this example has been updated to use [react-ga4](https://github.com/codler/react-ga4) instead.

This example shows the most basic way to use [react-ga4](https://github.com/codler/react-ga4) using a custom [App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js#custom-app)
component with Next.js. Modify `Tracking ID` in `utils/analytics.js` file for testing this example.
