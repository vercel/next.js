## Notes

### API key

To identify visitors, you'll need a FingerprintJS Pro account (you can [sign up for free](https://dashboard.fingerprintjs.com/signup/)).
You can learn more about API keys in the [official FingerprintJS Pro documentation](https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/quick-start-guide).

Once you get public key, you need to set up the API key in the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_FPJS_PUBLIC_API_KEY`.
