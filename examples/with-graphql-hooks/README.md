# GraphQL Hooks Example

[GraphQL Hooks](https://github.com/nearform/graphql-hooks) is a library from NearForm that intends to be a minimal hooks-first GraphQL client, providing a similar API to Apollo.

You'll see this shares the same layout as the `with-apollo` example, this is so you can compare the two side by side. The app itself should also look identical.

This started life as a copy of the `with-apollo` example. We then stripped out Apollo and replaced it with `graphql-hooks`. This was mostly as an exercise in ensuring basic functionality could be achieved in a similar way to Apollo. The [bundle size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=graphql-hooks) of `graphql-hooks` is tiny in comparison to Apollo and should cover a fair amount of use cases.
