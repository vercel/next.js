# GraphQL Gateway using GraphQL Mesh and Next.js API routes

This is a simple set up for Next.js using [GraphQL Mesh](https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/introduction) to build a GraphQL Gateway based on a REST API.

GraphQL Mesh is a framework that allows to build GraphQL Gateway server, based on one or multiple source APIs (REST, SOAP, gRPC, GraphQL or Databases).

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph AA [" "]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [" "]
E[REST API];
F[GraphQL API];
G[SOAP API];
end
Z[GraphQL Gateway API on a Next.js API route];
A & B & C --> Z;
Z --> E & F & G;
```

Configuring GraphQL Mesh only requires installing the required packages and providing a `.meshrc.yaml` configuration file.

This project translate the PetStore REST API (https://petstore.swagger.io/) to a GraphQL API by simply providing the following configuration:

_[`.meshrc.yaml`](./.meshrc.yaml)_

```yaml
sources:
  - name: PetStore
    handler:
      newOpenapi:
        baseUrl: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/
        oasFilePath: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
```

More information on GraphQL Mesh configuration and concepts [are available in our documentation](https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/getting-started/overview).

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-graphql-gateway with-graphql-gateway-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-graphql-gateway with-graphql-gateway-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-graphql-gateway with-graphql-gateway-app
```
