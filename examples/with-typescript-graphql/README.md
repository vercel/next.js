# TypeScript and GraphQL Example

One of the strengths of GraphQL is [enforcing data types on runtime](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion). Further, TypeScript and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (graphql-codegen) make it safer by typing data statically, so you can write truly type-protected code with rich IDE assists.

This template gives you the best start to use GraphQL with fully typed queries (client-side) and resolvers (server-side), all this with minimum bundle size üì¶

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client";
import { ViewerDocument } from "lib/graphql-operations";

const News = () => {
  // Typed alreadyÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
  const {
    data: { viewer },
  } = useQuery(ViewerDocument);

  return <div>{viewer.name}</div>;
};
```
