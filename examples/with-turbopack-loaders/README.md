# Turbopack + Loaders

Turbopack supports a subset of webpack's loader API, allowing you to use some webpack loaders to transform code in Turbopack. This example shows you how to configure Next.js to use webpack loaders when running with `next --turbo`.

Install the dependencies and start the development server.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

or

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
