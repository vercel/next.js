# Example app with Storybook

This example shows a default set up of Storybook using [`@storybook/nextjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/nextjs). Included in this example are stories that demonstrate the ability to use Next.js features in Storybook.

### TypeScript

As of v6.0, Storybook has built-in TypeScript support, so no configuration is needed. If you want to customize the default configuration, refer to the [TypeScript docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/typescript).
