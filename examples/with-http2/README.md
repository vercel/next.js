# HTTP2 server example

This example shows the most basic example using an HTTP2 server. We have 2 pages: `pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`. The former responds to `/` requests and the latter to `/about`. Using `next/link` you can add hyperlinks between them with universal routing capabilities.

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`
