## Notes

Look at the comments for more information on how the application is structured. This is just one of several ways you can manage hydration and rehydration of state. It depends heavily on how you want to manage it, do code sharing between client and server etc. The exampled approach should give you the hooks and flexibility to get you started on your endeavor :-)
