# Apollo Example

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/client/) is a GraphQL client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a GraphQL server. In addition to fetching and mutating data, Apollo analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations are run.

## Deploy your own
