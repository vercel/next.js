# Example app with polyfills

> ❗️ Warning: This example is not the suggested way to add polyfills and is known to cause issues with bundling. See [the browser support docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#custom-polyfills) for the correct way to load polyfills.

Next.js supports modern browsers and IE 11. It loads required polyfills automatically. If you need to add custom polyfills, you can follow this example.
