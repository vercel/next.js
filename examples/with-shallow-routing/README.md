# Shallow Routing Example

With [Shallow Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/shallow-routing), we can change the URL without running data fetching methods (like `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`) again.

We do this by passing the `shallow: true` option to `Router.push` or `Router.replace`.
