# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Theme and ColorMode containers so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

## Notes

Chakra has supported Gradients and RTL in `v1.1`. To utilize RTL, [add RTL direction and swap](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/rtl-support).

If you don't have multi-direction app, you should make `<Html lang="ar" dir="rtl">` inside `_document.js`.
