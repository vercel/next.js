# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js App Router with TypeScript.

Next.js and chakra-ui have built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for their modules straight away.

We are connecting the Next.js `next-themes` with `chakra-ui`'s Provider and theme so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.
