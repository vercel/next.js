# next-page-transitions example

The [`next-page-transitions`](https://github.com/illinois/next-page-transitions) library is a component that sits at the app level and allows you to animate page changes. It works especially nicely with apps with a shared layout element, like a navbar. This component will ensure that only one page is ever mounted at a time, and manages the timing of animations for you. This component works similarly to [`react-transition-group`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) in that it applies classes to a container around your page; it's up to you to write the CSS transitions or animations to make things pretty!

This example includes two pages with links between them. The "About" page demonstrates how `next-page-transitions` makes it easy to add a loading state when navigating to a page: it will wait for the page to "load" its content (in this examples, that's simulated with a timeout) and then hide the loading indicator and animate in the page when it's done.
