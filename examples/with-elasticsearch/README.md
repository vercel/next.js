## Example app using Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease. This example will show you how to connect to and use Elasticsearch as your search backend for your Next.js app.

## Deploy your own

Once you have access to the environment variables you'll need, deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-elasticsearch)

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-elasticsearch with-elasticsearch-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-elasticsearch with-elasticsearch-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-elasticsearch with-elasticsearch-app
```

## Configuration

### Set up Elasticsearch

Set up a Elasticsearch either locally or with [Elastic Cloud for free](https://elastic.co/cloud).

### Set up environment variables

Copy the `env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `ESS_CLOUD_ID` - URL for the Elasticsearch instance, if you are using [Elastic Cloud](https://elastic.co/cloud) you can find this in the Elastic Cloud console.
- `ESS_CLOUD_USERNAME` - The username for the Elasticsearch instance you have created, if you are using default user it would be `elastic`.
- `ESS_CLOUD_PASSWORD` - Password for the Elasticsearch instance

### Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

Please ensure that you have configured the env variables in the `.env.local`, if not you will see the message "You are not connected to Elasticsearch!" in the main page.

If you see that you are connected, you can refer to the [Elasticsearch NodeJS language client docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) for further instructions on querying Elasticsearch.

## Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy this app to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

#### Deploy Your Local Project

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.

#### Deploy from Our Template
