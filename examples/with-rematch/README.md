# Rematch example

This example has two pages. The first page has a counter which can be incremented synchronously or asynchronously. The second page is a page which shows a list of github users. It fetches data from the github api using this [endpoint](api.github.com/users).

Since rematch is utility which uses redux under the hood, some elements like `store.js` and `withRematch` are very similar to the `with-redux` example. Please go through the [`with-redux` example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux) before reading further if you are not familiar with how redux is integrated with Next.js. Rematch is just an extension for Redux so a lot of elements are the same.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-rematch with-rematch-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-rematch with-rematch-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-rematch with-rematch-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Directory structure

Besides the `pages` directory, there is a directory called shared which holds all of the code belonging to rematch. `Rematch` has a lot lesser boilerplate than `Redux` because it is able to put actions(including async actions), _models_ and reducers together. Hence, a `models` directory is present, which contains the logic for `counter` and `github` users.

Some features of this example are :

- Pages are connected to rematch using `withRematch` util. These pages are capable of accessing values from the store and dispatching changes
- Components are inside the `shared/components` folder. The `counter-display` component is connected to the store using the `connect` function to show how components which are not pages, can connect with Rematch.
- The file `shared/store` exports an initStore function which is used by `withRematch` to create store universally on the server and on the client.
