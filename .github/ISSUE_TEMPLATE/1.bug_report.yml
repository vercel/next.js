        This template is used for reporting a Next.js issue. [Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples)-related issues should be reported using [this](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+example%2Ctemplate%3A+bug&template=2.example_bug_report.yml) issue template instead.

        Feature requests should be opened in [discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas). For more information about opening a feature request, [read more](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/adding-features.md).

        Documentation requests should also be opened in [discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas).

        Before opening a new issue, please do a [search](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues) of existing issues and :+1: upvote the existing issue instead. This will result in a quicker resolution.

        If you need help with your own project, you can:
        - Start a discussion in the ["Help"](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/categories/help) section.
        - Ask a question in [Vercel Community](https://vercel.community/tags/c/help/9/nextjs).
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Link to the code that reproduces this issue
      description: |
        A link to a **public** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) or a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) minimal reproduction. Minimal reproductions should be created from our [bug report template with `npx create-next-app -e reproduction-template`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) and should include only changes that contribute to the issue. To report a Pages Router related issue, you can use these templates: [`npx create-next-app -e reproduction-template-pages`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages).

        If you decide to create your own minimal reproduction, please make sure test on canary. It is highly likely that the issue you are experiencing is already fixed in the canary version.

        Another way you can help the maintainers' job is to pinpoint the `canary` version of `next` that introduced the issue. Check out our [releases](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases), and try to find the first `canary` release that introduced the issue. This will help us narrow down the scope of the issue, and possibly point to the PR/code change that introduced it. You can install a specific version of `next` by running `npm install next@<version>`.

        Any extra information that might help us investigate. For example, where are you deploying your application (Vercel, Docker, other platform)? Is it only reproducible on that platform, or locally too? Is the issue only happening in a specific browser? etc.
      placeholder: |
        I tested my reproduction against different canary releases, and the first one that introduced the bug was "15.0.0-canary.148", since reverting to "15.0.0-canary.147" works.

        or

        I am hosting via Docker with the recommended `output: "standalone"` option, and if I remove that option or try a different hosting option, I cannot reproduce the same issue.
