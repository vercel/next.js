The Rspack team has created a community plugin for Next.js.

This is part of a [partnering effort](https://rspack.rs/blog/rspack-next-partner) with the Rspack team.

This plugin is currently experimental. Please use this [discussion thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77800), to give feedback and triage any issues you might find.

Read the [Rspack docs](https://rspack.rs/guide/tech/next), and try out [this example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-rspack).
