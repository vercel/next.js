The Rspack team has created a community plugin for Next.js, which is part of a [partnering effort](https://rspack.rs/blog/rspack-next-partner) with the Rspack team.

This plugin is currently experimental. Please use this [discussion thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77800) to give feedback on any issues you might find.

Learn more on the [Rspack docs](https://rspack.rs/guide/tech/next) and try out [this example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-rspack).
