Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

Middleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See [Matching Paths](#matching-paths) for more details.

## Use Cases

Some common scenarios where Middleware is effective include:

- Quick redirects after reading parts of the incoming request
- Rewriting to different pages based on A/B tests or experiments
- Modifying headers for all pages or a subset of pages

Middleware is _not_ a good fit for:

- Slow data fetching
- Session management

## Convention

Use the file `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `pages` or `app`, or inside `src` if applicable.

> **Note**: While only one `middleware.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `middleware.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the `middleware.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.

## Example

```ts filename="middleware.ts" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

```js filename="middleware.js" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```
