## Templates

Templates are similar to layouts in that they wrap a child layout or page. Unlike layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, templates create a new instance for each of their children on navigation. This means that when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the child is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is **not** preserved in Client Components, and effects are re-synchronized.

There may be cases where you need those specific behaviors, and templates would be a more suitable option than layouts. For example:

- To resynchronize `useEffect` on navigation.
- To reset the state of a child Client Components on navigation.

A template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a `template.js` file. The component should accept a `children` prop.

  alt="template.js special file"
  srcLight="/docs/light/template-special-file.png"
  srcDark="/docs/dark/template-special-file.png"
  width="1600"
  height="444"
/>

```tsx filename="app/template.tsx" switcher
export default function Template({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/template.js" switcher
export default function Template({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

In terms of nesting, `template.js` is rendered between a layout and its children. Here's a simplified output:

```jsx filename="Output"
<Layout>
  {/* Note that the template is given a unique key. */}
  <Template key={routeParam}>{children}</Template>
</Layout>
```
