## Upgrading from 13 to 14

To update to Next.js version 14, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@next-14 react@18 react-dom@18 && npm i eslint-config-next@next-14 -D
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add next@next-14 react@18 react-dom@18 && yarn add eslint-config-next@next-14 -D
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm i next@next-14 react@18 react-dom@18 && pnpm i eslint-config-next@next-14 -D
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun add next@next-14 react@18 react-dom@18 && bun add eslint-config-next@next-14 -D
```

> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their latest versions.

### v14 Summary

- The minimum Node.js version has been bumped from 16.14 to 18.17, since 16.x has reached end-of-life.
- The `next export` command has been removed in favor of `output: 'export'` config. Please see the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.
- The `next/server` import for `ImageResponse` was renamed to `next/og`. A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-og-import) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
- The `@next/font` package has been fully removed in favor of the built-in `next/font`. A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#built-in-next-font) to safely and automatically rename your imports.
- The WASM target for `next-swc` has been removed.
