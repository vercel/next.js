description: Upgrade your Next.js Application to canary and try out new features.
---

The Next.js canary channel is updated daily with the latest experimental features and bug fixes. It's a great way to try out new features and [give feedback](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues) before they are released in a stable version.

To upgrade to canary, make sure you're on the latest version of Next.js and everything is working as expected. See the [upgrade guides](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading) for more information.

Then, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@canary
# or
yarn add next@canary
# or
pnpm i next@canary
```
