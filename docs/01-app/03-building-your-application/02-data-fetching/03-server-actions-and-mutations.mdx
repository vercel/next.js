## Behavior

- The arguments and return value of Server Actions must be serializable by React. See the React docs for a list of [serializable arguments and values](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values).
- Server Actions inherit the runtime from the page or layout they are used on.
- Server Actions inherit the [Route Segment Config](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) from the page or layout they are used on, including fields like `maxDuration`.
- Usually, the Next.js TypeScript plugin would flag `updateItemAction` in `client-component.tsx` since it is a function which generally can't be serialized across client-server boundaries. However, props named `action` or ending with `Action` are assumed to receive Server Actions. This is only a heuristic since the TypeScript plugin doesn't actually know if it receives a Server Action or an ordinary function. Runtime type-checking will still ensure you don't accidentally pass a function to a Client Component.

## Security

By default, when a Server Action is created and exported, it creates a public HTTP endpoint
and should be treated with the same security assumptions and authorization checks. This means, even if a Server Action or utility function is not imported elsewhere in your code, itâ€™s still publicly accessible.

To improve security, Next.js has the following built-in features:

- **Secure action IDs:** Next.js creates encrypted, non-deterministic IDs to allow the client to reference and call the Server Action. These IDs are periodically recalculated between builds for enhanced security.
- **Dead code elimination:** Unused Server Actions (referenced by their IDs) are removed from client bundle to avoid public access by third-party.

> **Good to know**:
>
> The IDs are created during compilation and are cached for a maximum of 14 days. They will be regenerated when a new build is initiated or when the build cache is invalidated.
> This security improvement reduces the risk in cases where an authentication layer is missing. However, you should still treat Server Actions like public HTTP endpoints.

```jsx
// app/actions.js
'use server'

// This action **is** used in our application, so Next.js
// will create a secure ID to allow the client to reference
// and call the Server Action.
export async function updateUserAction(formData) {}

// This action **is not** used in our application, so Next.js
// will automatically remove this code during `next build`
// and will not create a public endpoint.
export async function deleteUserAction(formData) {}
```

### Authentication and authorization

You should ensure that the user is authorized to perform the action. For example:

```tsx filename="app/actions.ts"
'use server'

import { auth } from './lib'

export function addItem() {
  const { user } = auth()
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to perform this action')
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Closures and encryption

Defining a Server Action inside a component creates a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) where the action has access to the outer function's scope. For example, the `publish` action has access to the `publishVersion` variable:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const publishVersion = await getLatestVersion();

  async function publish() {
    "use server";
    if (publishVersion !== await getLatestVersion()) {
      throw new Error('The version has changed since pressing publish');
    }
    ...
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <button formAction={publish}>Publish</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default async function Page() {
  const publishVersion = await getLatestVersion();

  async function publish() {
    "use server";
    if (publishVersion !== await getLatestVersion()) {
      throw new Error('The version has changed since pressing publish');
    }
    ...
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <button formAction={publish}>Publish</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Closures are useful when you need to capture a _snapshot_ of data (e.g. `publishVersion`) at the time of rendering so that it can be used later when the action is invoked.

However, for this to happen, the captured variables are sent to the client and back to the server when the action is invoked. To prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client, Next.js automatically encrypts the closed-over variables. A new private key is generated for each action every time a Next.js application is built. This means actions can only be invoked for a specific build.

> **Good to know:** We don't recommend relying on encryption alone to prevent sensitive values from being exposed on the client. Instead, you should use the [React taint APIs](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/taint) to proactively prevent specific data from being sent to the client.

### Overwriting encryption keys (advanced)

When self-hosting your Next.js application across multiple servers, each server instance may end up with a different encryption key, leading to potential inconsistencies.

To mitigate this, you can overwrite the encryption key using the `process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Specifying this variable ensures that your encryption keys are persistent across builds, and all server instances use the same key. This variable **must** be AES-GCM encrypted.

This is an advanced use case where consistent encryption behavior across multiple deployments is critical for your application. You should consider standard security practices such key rotation and signing.

> **Good to know:** Next.js applications deployed to Vercel automatically handle this.

### Allowed origins (advanced)

Since Server Actions can be invoked in a `<form>` element, this opens them up to [CSRF attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF).

Behind the scenes, Server Actions use the `POST` method, and only this HTTP method is allowed to invoke them. This prevents most CSRF vulnerabilities in modern browsers, particularly with [SameSite cookies](https://web.dev/articles/samesite-cookies-explained) being the default.

As an additional protection, Server Actions in Next.js also compare the [Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) to the [Host header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) (or `X-Forwarded-Host`). If these don't match, the request will be aborted. In other words, Server Actions can only be invoked on the same host as the page that hosts it.

For large applications that use reverse proxies or multi-layered backend architectures (where the server API differs from the production domain), it's recommended to use the configuration option [`serverActions.allowedOrigins`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/serverActions) option to specify a list of safe origins. The option accepts an array of strings.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    serverActions: {
      allowedOrigins: ['my-proxy.com', '*.my-proxy.com'],
    },
  },
}
```
