Next.js has two server runtimes you can use in your application:

- The **Node.js Runtime** (default), which has access to all Node.js APIs and compatible packages from the ecosystem.
- The **Edge Runtime** which contains a more limited [set of APIs](/docs/app/api-reference/edge).

## Use Cases

- The Node.js Runtime is used for rendering your application.
- The Edge Runtime is used for Middleware (routing rules like redirects, rewrites, and setting headers).

## Caveats

- The Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs. Some packages may not work as expected. Learn more about the unsupported APIs in the [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/api-reference/edge#unsupported-apis).
- The Edge Runtime does not support Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
- Both runtimes can support [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) depending on your deployment infrastructure.
