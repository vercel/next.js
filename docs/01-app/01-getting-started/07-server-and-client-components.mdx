description: Learn how you can use React Server and Client Components to render parts of your application on the server or the client.

By default, Next.js uses React [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) which let you render parts of your UI on the server, optionally cache the result, and stream it to the client. When needed, you can use [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to add interactivity and use browser APIs.

This page will go through how Server and Client Components work, and common examples of when to use them.
