By default, Next.js uses React [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) which let you render parts of your UI on the server, optionally [cache](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating) the result, and [stream](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#streaming-server-components) it to the client. When needed, you can opt into using [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to add interactivity and use browser APIs.

This page will go through how Server and Client Components work, and common examples of when to use them.
