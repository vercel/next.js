description: Learn how you can use React Server and Client Components to render parts of your application on the server or the client.
---

By default, Next.js uses React [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) which let you render parts of your UI on the server, optionally [cache](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating) the result, and [stream](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#streaming-server-components) it to the client. When needed, you can opt into using [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to add interactivity and use browser APIs.

This page will go through how Server and Client Components work, and common examples of when to use them.

## How do Server and Client Components work?

### On the server

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments ([layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages)):

- **Server Components** are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
- **Client Components** are rendered into HTML.

> **What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?**
>
> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:
>
> - The rendered result of Server Components
> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component

### On the client (first load)

Then, on the client:

1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

> **What is hydration?**
>
> Hydration is React's process for attaching [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.

### Subsequent Navigations

On subsequent navigations:

- The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
- **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.
