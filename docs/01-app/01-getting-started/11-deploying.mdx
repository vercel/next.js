Once you're ready to deploy your Next.js app, you can choose a [managed infrastructure provider](#managed-infrastructure-providers) or [self-host](#self-hosting) your application.

## Managed infrastructure providers

A managed platform is a practical option for deploying your Next.js app, as these providers take care of hosting, scaling, and server configuration for you.

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), the creators and maintainers of Next.js, allows you to deploy your application with **full-feature support** and **zero-configuration**.

- Learn more about [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).
- Try Next.js on Vercel by [deploying a template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).

We also have community maintained deployment templates for:

- [Deno](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-deno)
- [Flightcontrol](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-flightcontrol)
- [Railway](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-railway)
- [Render](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-render)
- [SST](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-sst)

Please refer to each provider's documentation for information on supported Next.js features.

## Self-Hosting

Self-hosting may mean you're responsible for provisioning your own servers, managing containers, and scaling. You can self-host Next.js in three different ways:

- [A Node.js server](/docs/app/guides/self-hosting#nodejs-server)
- [A Docker container](/docs/app/guides/self-hosting#docker-image)
- [A static export](/docs/app/guides/self-hosting#static-html-export)

We have community maintained deployment examples with the following self-hosting providers:

- [DigitalOcean](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-digitalocean)
- [Fly.io](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-fly)
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-github-pages)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-google-cloud-run)
