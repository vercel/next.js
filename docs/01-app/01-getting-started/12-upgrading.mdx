## Latest version

To update to the latest version of Next.js, you can use the `upgrade` codemod:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
```

If you prefer to upgrade manually, install the latest Next.js and React versions:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
```

## Canary version

To update to the latest canary, make sure you're on the latest version of Next.js and everything is working as expected. Then, run the following command:
