The `layout` file is used to define a layout in your Next.js application.

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.js" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

A **root layout** is the top-most layout in the root `app` directory. It is used to define the `<html>` and `<body>` tags and other globally shared UI.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Reference

### Props

#### `children` (required)

Layout components accept and use a `children` prop. During rendering, `children` will be populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping. These will primarily be the component of a child [Layout](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) (if it exists) or [Page](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), but could also be other special files like [Loading](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) or [Error](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) when applicable.

#### `params` (optional)

A promise that resolves to an object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) object from the root segment down to that layout.

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/[team]/layout.tsx" switcher
export default async function Layout({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ team: string }>
}) {
  const { team } = await params
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/[team]/layout.js" switcher
export default async function Layout({ params }) {
  const { team } = await params
}
```

| Example Route                     | URL            | `params`                           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `app/dashboard/[team]/layout.js`  | `/dashboard/1` | `Promise<{ team: '1' }>`           |
| `app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js` | `/shop/1/2`    | `Promise<{ tag: '1', item: '2' }>` |
| `app/blog/[...slug]/layout.js`    | `/blog/1/2`    | `Promise<{ slug: ['1', '2'] }>`    |

- Since the `params` prop is a promise. You must use `async/await` or React's [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) function to access the values.
  - In version 14 and earlier, `params` was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.

### Root Layouts

The `app` directory **must** include a root `app/layout.js`.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

- The root layout **must** define `<html>` and `<body>` tags.
  - You should **not** manually add `<head>` tags such as `<title>` and `<meta>` to root layouts. Instead, you should use the [Metadata API](/docs/app/getting-started/metadata-and-og-images) which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating `<head>` elements.
- You can use [route groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to create multiple root layouts.
  - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts.

## Caveats

### Request Object

Layouts are cached in the client during navigation to avoid unnecessary server requests.

By restricting layouts from directly accessing the raw request object, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.

To access the request object, you can use [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) APIs in [Server Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) and Functions.

### Query params

Layouts do not rerender on navigation, so they cannot access search params which would otherwise become stale.

To access updated query parameters, you can use the Page[`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop, or read them inside a Client Component using the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook. Since Client Components re-render on navigation, they have access to the latest query parameters.

### Pathname

Layouts do not re-render on navigation, so they do not access pathname which would otherwise become stale.

To access the current pathname, you can read it inside a Client Component using the [`usePathname`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) hook. Since Client Components rerender (but are not refetched) during navigation, they have access to the latest pathname.
thout affecting performance.

### Fetching Data

Layouts cannot pass data to their `children`. However, you can fetch the same data in a route more than once, and use React [`cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to dedupe the requests without affecting performance.

> **Good to know:** When using [`fetch`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) Next.js, requests are automatically deduped.

### Accessing child segments

Layouts do not have access to the route segments below itself. To access all route segments, you can use [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment) or [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) in a Client Component.

## Examples

### Displaying content based on `params`

Using [dynamic route segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), you can display or fetch specific content based on the `params` prop.

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx" switcher
export default async function DashboardLayout({
  children,
  params,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  params: Promise<{ team: string }>
}) {
  const { team } = await params

  return (
    <section>
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to {team}'s Dashboard</h1>
      </header>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </section>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.js" switcher
export default async function DashboardLayout({ children, params }) {
  const { team } = await params

  return (
    <section>
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to {team}'s Dashboard</h1>
      </header>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </section>
  )
}
```

### Reading `params` in Client Components

To use `params` in a Client Component (which cannot be `async`), you can use React's [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) function to read the promise:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { use } from 'react'

export default function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = use(params)
}
```

```js filename="app/page.js" switcher
'use client'

import { use } from 'react'

export default function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = use(params)
}
```
