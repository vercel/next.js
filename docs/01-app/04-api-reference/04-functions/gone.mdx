description: API Reference for the gone function.
---

The `gone()` function allows you to render the [`gone.js` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/gone) within a route segment as well as inject a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` tag.

## `gone()`

Invoking the `gone()` function throws a `NEXT_HTTP_ERROR_FALLBACK` error and terminates rendering of the route segment in which it was thrown. Specifying a [**gone** file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/gone) allows you to gracefully handle such errors by rendering a Gone UI within the segment.

```jsx filename="app/post/[slug]/page.js"
import { gone } from 'next/navigation'

async function fetchPost(slug) {
  const res = await fetch('https://...')
  if (res.status === 410) return undefined
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Post({ params }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(params.slug)

  if (!post) {
    gone()
  }

  // Continue rendering if post exists...
  return <PostUI post={post} />
}
```

### When to Use `gone()`

The HTTP 410 status code indicates that the resource once existed but has been permanently removed and will not be available again. This differs from a 404 status code which indicates that a resource could not be found but might appear later.

Use `gone()` when:

- A resource has been deliberately removed and won't be coming back
- You want to clearly communicate to users and search engines that the content is permanently gone
- You want to maintain your SEO by properly distinguishing between nonexistent resources (404) and deliberately removed ones (410)

### Returns

`gone()` does not return anything as it throws an error to stop the rendering of the route segment.

### Examples

#### Handling Deleted Content

```jsx filename="app/products/[id]/page.js"
import { gone } from 'next/navigation'
import { getProduct, isProductDeleted } from '@/lib/products'

export default async function Product({ params }) {
  // Check if product was explicitly deleted
  if (await isProductDeleted(params.id)) {
    // Respond with a 410 Gone status
    gone()
  }

  const product = await getProduct(params.id)

  // Handle product not found (404 case)
  if (!product) {
    notFound()
  }

  return <ProductDetails product={product} />
}
```

#### Using with a Custom Gone UI

You can create a custom UI for 410 responses by creating a `gone.js` file in the appropriate route segment:

```jsx filename="app/products/gone.js"
export default function ProductGone() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Removed</h1>
      <p>This product has been permanently removed from our catalog.</p>
      <p>
        You may want to browse our <a href="/products">current products</a>{' '}
        instead.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
