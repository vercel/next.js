Before continuing to add custom webpack configuration to your application make sure Next.js doesn't already support your use-case:

Some commonly asked for features are available as plugins:

- [@next/mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx)
- [@next/bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer)

In order to extend our usage of `webpack`, you can define a function that extends its config inside `next.config.js`, like so:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  webpack: (
    config,
    { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, nextRuntime, webpack }
  ) => {
    // Important: return the modified config
    return config
  },
}
```

> The `webpack` function is executed three times, twice for the server (nodejs / edge runtime) and once for the client. This allows you to distinguish between client and server configuration using the `isServer` property.

The second argument to the `webpack` function is an object with the following properties:

- `buildId`: `String` - The build id, used as a unique identifier between builds.
- `dev`: `Boolean` - Indicates if the compilation will be done in development.
- `isServer`: `Boolean` - It's `true` for server-side compilation, and `false` for client-side compilation.
- `nextRuntime`: `String | undefined` - The target runtime for server-side compilation; either `"edge"` or `"nodejs"`, it's `undefined` for client-side compilation.
- `defaultLoaders`: `Object` - Default loaders used internally by Next.js:
  - `babel`: `Object` - Default `babel-loader` configuration.

Example usage of `defaultLoaders.babel`:

```js
// Example config for adding a loader that depends on babel-loader
// This source was taken from the @next/mdx plugin source:
// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mdx/,
      use: [
        options.defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
          options: pluginOptions.options,
        },
      ],
    })

    return config
  },
}
```

#### `nextRuntime`

Notice that `isServer` is `true` when `nextRuntime` is `"edge"` or `"nodejs"`, `nextRuntime` `"edge"` is currently for middleware and Server Components in edge runtime only.
