{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

> This feature is exclusive to `next export` and currently **deprecated** in favor of `getStaticPaths` with `pages` or `generateStaticParams` with `app`.

`exportPathMap` allows you to specify a mapping of request paths to page destinations, to be used during export. Paths defined in `exportPathMap` will also be available when using [`next dev`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-dev-options).

Let's start with an example, to create a custom `exportPathMap` for an app with the following pages:

- `pages/index.js`
- `pages/about.js`
- `pages/post.js`

Open `next.config.js` and add the following `exportPathMap` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: async function (
    defaultPathMap,
    { dev, dir, outDir, distDir, buildId }
  ) {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' },
      '/about': { page: '/about' },
      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'hello-nextjs' } },
      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'learn-nextjs' } },
      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'deploy-nextjs' } },
    }
  },
}
```

> **Good to know**: the `query` field in `exportPathMap` cannot be used with [automatically statically optimized pages](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) or [`getStaticProps` pages](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) as they are rendered to HTML files at build-time and additional query information cannot be provided during `next export`.

The pages will then be exported as HTML files, for example, `/about` will become `/about.html`.

`exportPathMap` is an `async` function that receives 2 arguments: the first one is `defaultPathMap`, which is the default map used by Next.js. The second argument is an object with:

- `dev` - `true` when `exportPathMap` is being called in development. `false` when running `next export`. In development `exportPathMap` is used to define routes.
- `dir` - Absolute path to the project directory
- `outDir` - Absolute path to the `out/` directory ([configurable with `-o`](#customizing-the-output-directory)). When `dev` is `true` the value of `outDir` will be `null`.
- `distDir` - Absolute path to the `.next/` directory (configurable with the [`distDir`](/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/distDir) config)
- `buildId` - The generated build id

The returned object is a map of pages where the `key` is the `pathname` and the `value` is an object that accepts the following fields:

- `page`: `String` - the page inside the `pages` directory to render
- `query`: `Object` - the `query` object passed to `getInitialProps` when prerendering. Defaults to `{}`

> The exported `pathname` can also be a filename (for example, `/readme.md`), but you may need to set the `Content-Type` header to `text/html` when serving its content if it is different than `.html`.

## Adding a trailing slash

It is possible to configure Next.js to export pages as `index.html` files and require trailing slashes, `/about` becomes `/about/index.html` and is routable via `/about/`. This was the default behavior prior to Next.js 9.

To switch back and add a trailing slash, open `next.config.js` and enable the `trailingSlash` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

## Customizing the output directory

<AppOnly>

[`next export`](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) will use `out` as the default output directory, you can customize this using the `-o` argument, like so:

</AppOnly>

<PagesOnly>

[`next export`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) will use `out` as the default output directory, you can customize this using the `-o` argument, like so:

</PagesOnly>

```bash filename="Terminal"
next export -o outdir
```

> **Warning**: Using `exportPathMap` is deprecated and is overridden by `getStaticPaths` inside `pages`. We don't recommend using them together.
