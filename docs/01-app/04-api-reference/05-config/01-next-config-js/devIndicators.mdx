`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicators that give context about the current route you're viewing during development.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus?: boolean, // defaults to true
    buildActivity?: boolean, // defaults to true
    buildActivityPosition?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-right'
  },
```

## `appIsrStatus` (Static Indicator)

Next.js displays a static indicator in the bottom corner of the screen that signals if a route will be prerendered at build time. This makes it easier to understand whether a route is static or dynamic, and for you to identify if a route [opts out of static rendering](#static-route-not-showing-the-indicator).

You can temporarily hide the indicator by clicking the close indicator which will remember your preference in `localStorage` for 1 hour. To permanently disable it, you can use the config option in `next.config.js`:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## `buildActivity` (Compilation Indicator)

When you edit your code, and Next.js is compiling the application, a compilation indicator appears in the bottom right corner of the page.

> **Good to know**: This indicator is only present in development mode and will not appear when building and running the app in production mode.

In some cases this indicator can be misplaced on your page, for example, when conflicting with a chat launcher. To change its position, open `next.config.js` and set the `buildActivityPosition` in the `devIndicators` object to `bottom-right` (default), `bottom-left`, `top-right` or `top-left`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivityPosition: 'bottom-right',
  },
}
```

In some cases, this indicator might not be useful for you. To remove it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `buildActivity` config in `devIndicators` object:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false,
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Static route not showing the indicator

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator is enabled but not showing, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) or [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

```bash filename="Build Output"
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

There are two reasons a route might opt out of static rendering:

- The presence of [Dynamic APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-apis) which rely on runtime information.
- An [uncached data request](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching), like a call to an ORM or database driver.

Check your route for any of these conditions, and if you are not able to statically render the route, then consider using [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) or [`<Suspense />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to leverage [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#what-is-streaming).

> **Good to know**: This indicator was removed in Next.js version 10.0.1. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js.

When a page qualifies for [Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) we show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on electron applications. To remove it open `next.config.js` and disable the `autoPrerender` config in `devIndicators`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```
