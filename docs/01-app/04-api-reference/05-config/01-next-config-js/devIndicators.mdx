`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicators that give context about the current route you're viewing during development.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivityPosition?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-right'
  },
```

## Troubleshooting

### Static route not showing the indicator

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator is enabled but not showing, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) or [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

```bash filename="Build Output"
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

There are two reasons a route might opt out of static rendering:

- The presence of [Dynamic APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-apis) which rely on runtime information.
- An [uncached data request](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching), like a call to an ORM or database driver.

Check your route for any of these conditions, and if you are not able to statically render the route, then consider using [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) or [`<Suspense />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to leverage [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#what-is-streaming).

> **Good to know**: This indicator was removed in Next.js version 10.0.1. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js.

When a page qualifies for [Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) we show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on electron applications. To remove it open `next.config.js` and disable the `autoPrerender` config in `devIndicators`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```
