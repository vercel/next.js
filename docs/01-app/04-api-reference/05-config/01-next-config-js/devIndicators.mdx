`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicator that gives context about the current route you're viewing during development.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: false | {
    position?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-left',
  },
```

Setting `devIndicators` to `false` will hide the indicator, however Next.js will continue to surface any build or runtime errors that were encountered.

## Troubleshooting

### Indicator not marking a route as static

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) or [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

```bash filename="Build Output"
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /_not-found                          0 B               0 kB
└ ƒ /products/[id]                       0 B               0 kB

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

There are two reasons a route might opt out of static rendering:

- The presence of [Dynamic APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-apis) which rely on runtime information.
- An [uncached data request](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching), like a call to an ORM or database driver.

Check your route for any of these conditions, and if you are not able to statically render the route, then consider using [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) or [`<Suspense />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to leverage [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#what-is-streaming).

When exporting [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props) from a page, it will be marked as dynamic.
