description: Enable ViewTransition API from React in App Router
version: experimental
---

`viewTransition` is an experimental feature that a feature flag to enable the new experimental [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) with React. This new API allows you to leverage the View Transition browser API to create seamless transitions.

To enable this feature, you need to set the `viewTransition` property to `true` in your `next.config.js` file.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

> Note: This feature is highly experimental and may change in future releases.

## Usage

Once enabled, you can import the `ViewTransition` component from React in your application:

```jsx
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react'
```

For more details on how to use this feature, refer to the [original View Transitions pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31975) in the React repository. This feature builds upon the native browser implementation of View Transitions.
