`viewTransition` is an experimental feature that a feature flag to enable the new experimental View Transitions API in React. This new API allows you to animate between different views and components in your application.

To enable this feature, you need to set the `viewTransition` property to `true` in your `next.config.js` file.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

> Note: This feature is highly experimental and may change in future releases.

## Usage

Once enabled, you can import the View Transitions API in your application:

```jsx
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react'
```

For more details on how to use this feature, refer to the [original View Transitions pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31975) in the React repository. This feature builds upon the native browser implementation of View Transitions.
