To configure a Next.js application to allow requests from origins other than the hostname the server was booted with or localhost you can use the `allowedDevOrigins` config option.

`allowedDevOrigins` allows you to set additional origins that can be used in dev mode. For example, to use `local-origin.dev` instead of only `localhost`, open `next.config.js` and add the `allowedDevOrigins` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  allowedDevOrigins: ['local-origin.dev'],
}
```

The reason for cross-origin requests are blocked by default is to prevent unauthorized requesting of internal assets/endpoints which are available in dev mode. This behavior is also present in other dev servers like webpack-dev-middleware to ensure the same protection.
