title: Supported Browsers
description: Browser support and which JavaScript features are supported by Next.js.
---

Next.js supports **modern browsers** with zero configuration.

- Chrome 64+
- Edge 79+
- Firefox 67+
- Opera 51+
- Safari 12+

## Browserslist

If you would like to target specific browsers or features, Next.js supports [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist) configuration in your `package.json` file. Next.js uses the following Browserslist configuration by default:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "browserslist": [
    "chrome 64",
    "edge 79",
    "firefox 67",
    "opera 51",
    "safari 12"
  ]
}
```

## Polyfills

We inject [widely used polyfills](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next-polyfill-nomodule/src/index.js), including:

- [**fetch()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) — Replacing: `whatwg-fetch` and `unfetch`.
- [**URL**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL) — Replacing: the [`url` package (Node.js API)](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).
- [**Object.assign()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) — Replacing: `object-assign`, `object.assign`, and `core-js/object/assign`.

If any of your dependencies include these polyfills, they’ll be eliminated automatically from the production build to avoid duplication.

In addition, to reduce bundle size, Next.js will only load these polyfills for browsers that require them. The majority of the web traffic globally will not download these polyfills.

### Custom Polyfills

If your own code or any external npm dependencies require features not supported by your target browsers (such as IE 11), you need to add polyfills yourself.

<PagesOnly>
In this case, you should add a top-level import for the **specific polyfill** you need in your [Custom `<App>`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) or the individual component.
</PagesOnly>

<AppOnly>
For polyfills that must load early, use `next/script` with the `beforeInteractive` strategy.

This can negatively impact users with modern browsers, so avoid it when possible.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"

export default function Layout(/* layout props */) {
  return (
    {/* other UI elements */}
    <Script strategy="beforeInteractive" src="https://source-to-the-polyfill/" />
    {/* A vendor script, that needs the polyfill, and also needs to run immediately */}
    <Script strategy="beforeInteractive" src="https://critical-vendor-script/" />
    {/* rest of UI */}
  )
}
```

For other cases, you can create a client module that loads the polyfills you need.

```tsx filename="app/polyfill.ts"
'use client'
import languageFeature from 'polyfill-for-feature'

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
   // check if the polyfill needs to be applied
}


export Polyfill = null
```

And use it in your root layout.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { Polyfill } from './polyfill'

export default function Layout(/* layout props */) {
  return (
    {/* other UI elements */}
    {Polyfill}
    {/* rest of UI */}
  )
}
```

Using this strategy prevents dead-code elimination from removing the polyfill and marks its usage explicitly.

The best approach is to isolate unsupported features to specific UI sections and conditionally load the polyfill before using them.

```ts filename="hooks/analytics.ts" switcher
import { useCallback } from 'react'

export const useAnalytics = () => {
  const tracker = useCallback(async (data: unknown) => {
    if (!('structuredClone' in globalThis)) {
      globalThis.structuredClone = await import('polyfills/structured-clone')
    }

    /* Do some work that uses structured clone */
  }, [])

  return tracker
}
```

```js filename="hooks/analytics.js" switcher
import { useCallback } from 'react'

export const useAnalytics = () => {
  const tracker = useCallback(async (data) => {
    if (!('structuredClone' in globalThis)) {
      globalThis.structuredClone = await import('polyfills/structured-clone')
    }

    /* Do some work that uses structured clone */
  }, [])

  return tracker
}
```

</AppOnly>

## JavaScript Language Features

Next.js allows you to use the latest JavaScript features out of the box. In addition to [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), Next.js also supports:

- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017)
- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018)
- [Dynamic `import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (ES2020)
- [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) (ES2020)
- [Nullish Coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing) (ES2020)
- [Class Fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) and [Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-static-class-features) (ES2022)
- and more!
