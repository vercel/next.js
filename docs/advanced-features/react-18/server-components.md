# React Server Components

React Server Components allow developers to build applications that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.

In Next.js 13, you can start using the `app/` directory (beta) which uses Server Components by default. Learn more by reading the `app/` directory (beta) documentation:

- [Rendering Fundamentals](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/fundamentals)
- [Server and Client Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components)

[Deploy the `app/` directory example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/app-directory) to try Server Components.
