# Trailing Slash

> This feature was introduced in [Next.js 9.5](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5) and up. If you’re using older versions of Next.js, please upgrade before trying it out.

By default Next.js will redirect urls with trailing slashes to their counterpart without a trailing slash. For example `/about/` will redirect to `/about`. You can configure this behavior to act the opposite way, where urls without trailing slashes are redirected to their counterparts with trailing slashes.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `trailingSlash` config:

```js
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

With this option set, urls like `/about` will redirect to `/about/`.
