description: Configure Next.js pages to resolve with or without a trailing slash.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

By default Next.js will redirect urls with trailing slashes to their counterpart without a trailing slash. For example `/about/` will redirect to `/about`. You can configure this behavior to act the opposite way, where urls without trailing slashes are redirected to their counterparts with trailing slashes.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `trailingSlash` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

With this option set, urls like `/about` will redirect to `/about/`.

When used with [`output: "export"`](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) configuration, the `/about` page will output `/about/index.html` (instead of the default `/about.html`).
