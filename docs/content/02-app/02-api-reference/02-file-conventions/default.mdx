The `default.js` file is used to render a fallback within [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) when Next.js cannot recover a [slot's](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#slots) active state after a full-page load.

During [soft navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#5-soft-navigation), Next.js keeps track of the active _state_ (subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a `default.js` file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.

Consider the following folder structure. The `@team` slot has a `settings` page, but `@analytics` does not.

/>

When navigating to `/settings`, the `@team` slot will render the `settings` page while maintaining the currently active page for the `@analytics` slot.

On refresh, Next.js will render a `default.js` for `@analytics`. If `default.js` doesn't exist, a `404` is rendered instead.

Additionally, since `children` is an implicit slot, you also need to create a `default.js` file to render a fallback for `children` when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.

## Props

### `params` (optional)

An object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) from the root segment down to the slot's subpages. For example:

| Example                                    | URL          | `params`                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `app/[artist]/@sidebar/default.js`         | `/zack`      | `{ artist: 'zack' }`                |
| `app/[artist]/[album]/@sidebar/default.js` | `/zack/next` | `{ artist: 'zack', album: 'next' }` |
