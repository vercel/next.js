</details>

With Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.

You can read more about AMP in the official [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) site.

## Enabling AMP

To enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the [API documentation for `next/amp`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).

## Caveats

- Only CSS-in-JS is supported. [CSS Modules](/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can [contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10549).

## Adding AMP Components

The AMP community provides [many components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/) to make AMP pages more interactive. Next.js will automatically import all components used on a page and there is no need to manually import AMP component scripts:

```jsx
export const config = { amp: true }

function MyAmpPage() {
  const date = new Date()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>
      <amp-timeago
        width="0"
        height="15"
        datetime={date.toJSON()}
        layout="responsive"
      >
        .
      </amp-timeago>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyAmpPage
```

The above example uses the [`amp-timeago`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-timeago/?format=websites) component.

By default, the latest version of a component is always imported. If you want to customize the version, you can use `next/head`, as in the following example:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'

export const config = { amp: true }

function MyAmpPage() {
  const date = new Date()

  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <script
          async
          key="amp-timeago"
          custom-element="amp-timeago"
          src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-timeago-0.1.js"
        />
      </Head>

      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>
      <amp-timeago
        width="0"
        height="15"
        datetime={date.toJSON()}
        layout="responsive"
      >
        .
      </amp-timeago>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyAmpPage
```

## AMP Validation

AMP pages are automatically validated with [amphtml-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator) during development. Errors and warnings will appear in the terminal where you started Next.js.

Pages are also validated during [Static HTML export](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) and any warnings / errors will be printed to the terminal. Any AMP errors will cause the export to exit with status code `1` because the export is not valid AMP.

### Custom Validators

You can set up custom AMP validator in `next.config.js` as shown below:

```js
module.exports = {
  amp: {
    validator: './custom_validator.js',
  },
}
```

### Skip AMP Validation

To turn off AMP validation add the following code to `next.config.js`

```js
experimental: {
  amp: {
    skipValidation: true
  }
}
```

### AMP in Static HTML Export

When using [Static HTML export](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) statically prerender pages, Next.js will detect if the page supports AMP and change the exporting behavior based on that.

For example, the hybrid AMP page `pages/about.js` would output:

- `out/about.html` - HTML page with client-side React runtime
- `out/about.amp.html` - AMP page

And if `pages/about.js` is an AMP-only page, then it would output:

- `out/about.html` - Optimized AMP page

Next.js will automatically insert a link to the AMP version of your page in the HTML version, so you don't have to, like so:

```jsx
<link rel="amphtml" href="/about.amp.html" />
```

And the AMP version of your page will include a link to the HTML page:

```jsx
<link rel="canonical" href="/about" />
```

When [`trailingSlash`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/trailingSlash) is enabled the exported pages for `pages/about.js` would be:

- `out/about/index.html` - HTML page
- `out/about.amp/index.html` - AMP page

## TypeScript

AMP currently doesn't have built-in types for TypeScript, but it's in their roadmap ([#13791](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13791)).

As a workaround you can manually create a file called `amp.d.ts` inside your project and add these [custom types](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50601125).
