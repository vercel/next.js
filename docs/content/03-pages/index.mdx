Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js. It used an intuitive file-system router to map each file to a route. The Pages Router is still supported in newer versions of Next.js, but we recommend migrating to the new [App Router](/docs/app) to leverage React's latest features.

Use this section of the documentation for existing applications that use the Pages Router.
