The Next.js team is committed to making Next.js accessible to all developers (and their end-users). By adding accessibility features to Next.js by default, we aim to make the Web more inclusive for everyone.

## Route Announcements

When transitioning between pages rendered on the server (e.g. using the `<a href>` tag) screen readers and other assistive technology announce the page title when the page loads so that users understand that the page has changed.

In addition to traditional page navigations, Next.js also supports client-side transitions for improved performance (using `next/link`). To ensure that client-side transitions are also announced to assistive technology, Next.js includes a route announcer by default.

The Next.js route announcer looks for the page name to announce by first inspecting `document.title`, then the `<h1>` element, and finally the URL pathname. For the most accessible user experience, ensure that each page in your application has a unique and descriptive title.

## Linting

Next.js provides an [integrated ESLint experience](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) out of the box, including custom rules for Next.js. By default, Next.js includes `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to help catch accessibility issues early, including warning on:

- [aria-props](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/aria-props.md?rgh-link-date=2021-06-04T02%3A10%3A36Z)
- [aria-proptypes](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/aria-proptypes.md?rgh-link-date=2021-06-04T02%3A10%3A36Z)
- [aria-unsupported-elements](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/aria-unsupported-elements.md?rgh-link-date=2021-06-04T02%3A10%3A36Z)
- [role-has-required-aria-props](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/role-has-required-aria-props.md?rgh-link-date=2021-06-04T02%3A10%3A36Z)
- [role-supports-aria-props](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/role-supports-aria-props.md?rgh-link-date=2021-06-04T02%3A10%3A36Z)

For example, this plugin helps ensure you add alt text to `img` tags, use correct `aria-*` attributes, use correct `role` attributes, and more.
