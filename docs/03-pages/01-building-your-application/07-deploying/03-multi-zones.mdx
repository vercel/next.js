A zone is a single deployment of a Next.js app. You can have multiple zones and merge them as a single app.

For example, let's say you have the following apps:

- An app for serving `/blog/**`
- Another app for serving all other pages

With multi zones support, you can merge both these apps into a single one allowing your customers to browse it using a single URL, but you can develop and deploy both apps independently.

## How to define a zone

There are no zone related APIs. You only need to do the following:

- Make sure to keep only the pages you need in your app, meaning that an app can't have pages from another app, if app `A` has `/blog` then app `B` shouldn't have it too.
- Make sure to configure a [basePath](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) to avoid conflicts with pages and static files.

## How to merge zones

You can merge zones using [`rewrites`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) in one of the apps or any HTTP proxy.

For [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) applications, you can use a [monorepo](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to deploy both apps with a single `git push`.
