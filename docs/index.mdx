Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations like routing, server rendering, and more.

It also handles configuration for bundlers and compilers, so you can focus on building your application-not managing tooling.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

## How to use the docs

The docs are organized into 4 sections:

- [Getting Started](/docs/app/getting-started): Step-by-step tutorials to help you create a new application and learn the core Next.js features.
- [Guides](/docs/app/guides): Tutorials on specific use cases, choose what's relevant to you.
- [Deep Dive](/docs/app/deep-dive): In-depth explanations on how Next.js works.
- [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference): Detailed technical reference for every feature.

Use the sidebar to navigate to navigate through the sections, or search (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) to quickly find a page.

## App Router and Pages Router

Next.js has two different routers:

- **App Router**: The newer router that supports React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming.
- **Pages Router**: The original router, still supported for older applications.

At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the [App Router](/docs/app) and the [Pages Router](/docs/pages) docs.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

Our documentation is designed to be beginner-friendly, but we assume some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our [React Foundations course](/learn/react-foundations). We also recommend the [Next.js Foundations course](/learn/dashboard-app) that has you building an application as you learn.

## Accessibility

For the best experience when using a screen reader, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.
