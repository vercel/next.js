title: Statics Assets in `public`
nav_title: Static Assets
description: Next.js allows you to serve static files, like images, in the public directory. You can learn how it works here.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

For example, if you add `me.png` inside `public`, the following code will access the image:

```jsx filename="Avatar.js"
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Avatar() {
  return <Image src="/me.png" alt="me" width="64" height="64" />
}
```

## Caching

Next.js automatically adds caching headers to immutable assets in the `public` folder. The default caching headers applied are:

```jsx
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## Robots, Favicons, and others

<PagesOnly>

The folder is also useful for `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, Google Site Verification, and any other static files (including `.html`). But make sure to not have a static file with the same name as a file in the `pages/` directory, as this will result in an error. [Read more](/docs/messages/conflicting-public-file-page).

</PagesOnly>

<AppOnly>

For static metadata files, such as `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, etc, you should use [special metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) inside the `app` folder.

</AppOnly>

> Good to know:
>
> - The directory must be named `public`. The name cannot be changed and it's the only directory used to serve static assets.
> - Only assets that are in the `public` directory at [build time](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) will be served by Next.js. Files added at request time won't be available. We recommend using a third-party service like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for persistent file storage.
