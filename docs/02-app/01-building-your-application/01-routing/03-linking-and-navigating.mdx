description: Learn how navigation works in Next.js, and how to use the Link Component and `useRouter` hook.
---

There are two ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:

- Using [`<Link>` Component](#link-component)
- Using [`useRouter` Hook](#userouter-hook)

This page will go through how to use `<Link>`, `useRouter()`, and dive deeper into how navigation works.

## `<Link>` Component

`<Link>` is a built-in component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide [prefetching](#prefetching) and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

You can use it by importing it from `next/link`, and passing a `href` prop to the component:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
}
```

There are other optional props you can pass to `<Link>`. See the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more.

### Examples

#### Linking to Dynamic Segments

When linking to [dynamic segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), you can use [template literals and interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:

```jsx filename="app/blog/PostList.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function PostList({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

#### Checking Active Links

You can use [`usePathname()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) to determine if a link is active. For example, to add a class to the active link, you can check if the current `pathname` matches the `href` of the link:

```jsx filename="app/ui/Navigation.js"
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
import Link from 'next/link'

export function Navigation({ navLinks }) {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  return (
    <>
      {navLinks.map((link) => {
        const isActive = pathname.startsWith(link.href)

        return (
          <Link
            className={isActive ? 'text-blue' : 'text-black'}
            href={link.href}
            key={link.name}
          >
            {link.name}
          </Link>
        )
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Scrolling to an `id`

The default behavior of `<Link>` is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and fowards navigation.

If you'd like to scroll to a specific `id` on navigation, you can append the `href` string with a `#` hash link since `<Link>` renders to a `<a>` tag.

```jsx
<Link href="/dashboard#settings">Settings</Link>

// Output
<a href="/dashboard#settings">Settings</a>
```

## `useRouter()` Hook

The `useRouter` hook allows you to programmatically change routes.

Since it's a hook, you can only use it inside Client Components. The hook is imported from `next/navigation`.

```jsx filename="app/page.js"
'use client'

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>
      Dashboard
    </button>
  )
}
```

For a full list of `useRouter` methods, see the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).

> **Recommendation:** Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.

## How Routing and Navigation Works

The App Router uses a hybrid approach for routing and navigation. On the server, your application code is automatically code-split by route segments. And on the client, Next.js [prefetches](#1-prefetching) and [caches](#2-caching) the route segments. This means, when a user navigates to a new route, the browser doesn't reload the page, and only the route segments that change re-render - improving navigation performance.

### 1. Prefetching

Prefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before the user visits it.

There are two ways routes are prefetched in Next.js:

- **`<Link>` component**: Routes are automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's viewport. Prefetching happens when the page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling.
- **`router.prefetch()`**: The `useRouter` hook can be used to prefetched routes programmatically.

The`<Link>`'s prefetching behavior is different for static and dynamic routes:

- [**Static Routes**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#static-rendering-default): `prefetch` defaults to `true`. The whole route is prefetched and cached.
- [**Dynamic Routes**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#dynamic-rendering): `prefetch` default to `false`. Only the shared layout down until the first `loading.js` file is prefetched and cached for 30s. This reduces the cost of fetching an entire dynamic route, and it means you can show an [instant loading state](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states).

> **Good to know**:

### 2. Caching

Next.js has an **in-memory client-side cache** called the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching#router-cache). As users navigate around the app, the React Server Component Payload of [prefetched](#prefetching) route segments and visited routes are stored in the cache.

This means on navigation, the cache is reused as much as possible, instead of making a new request to the server; improving performance by reducing the numbers of requests and data transferred.

Learn more about the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching).

#### 3. Partial Rendering

Partial rendering means only the route segments that change on navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are preserved.

For example, when navigating between two sibling routes, `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`, the `settings` and `analytics` pages will be rendered, and the shared `dashboard` layout will be preseved.

/>

Without partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the server. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.

#### 4. Soft Navigation

By default, the browser performs a hard navigation between pages. This means the browser reloads the page and resets the React state. However, in Next.js, the App Router uses soft navigation. This means React renders the segments that have changed while preserving browser and React state, and there is no page reload.

#### 5. Back and Forward Navigation

By default, Next.js will maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation, and re-use route segments in the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching).
