> **Warning**: Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature and is currently **not suitable for production environments**.

Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature that allows static portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.

Partial Prerendering is available in `next@canary`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@canary
```

You can enable Partial Prerendering by setting the experimental `ppr` flag:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

> **Good to know:**
>
> - Partial Prerendering does not yet apply to client-side navigations. We are actively working on this.
> - Partial Prerendering is designed for the [Node.js runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) only. Using the subset of the Node.js runtime is not needed when you can instantly serve the static shell.
