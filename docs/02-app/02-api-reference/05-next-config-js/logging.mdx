description: Configure how data fetches are logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

You can configure the logging level and whether the full URL is logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.

Currently, `logging` only applies to data fetching using the `fetch` API. It does not yet apply to other logs inside of Next.js.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  logging: {
    fetches: {
      fullUrl: true,
    },
  },
}
```
