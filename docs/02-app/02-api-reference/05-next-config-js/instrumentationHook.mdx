The experimental `instrumentationHook` option allows you to set up instrumentation via the [`instrumentation` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation) in your Next.js App.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    instrumentationHook: true,
  },
}
```
