Turbopack can be customized to transform different files and change how modules are resolved.

> **Good to know**:
>
> - These features are experimental and will only work with `next --turbo`.
> - Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality. Turbopack has built-in support for css and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're using `@babel/preset-env`.

## webpack loaders

If you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:

- Only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.
- Only loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.
- Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.

To configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in `next.config.js`, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      rules: {
        '*.svg': {
          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],
          as: '*.js',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> **Good to know**: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, `experimental.turbo.rules` was named `experimental.turbo.loaders` and only accepted file extensions like `.mdx` instead of `*.mdx`.

### Supported loaders

The following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:

- [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)
- [`@svgr/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack)
- [`svg-inline-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-inline-loader)
- [`yaml-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-loader)
- [`string-replace-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-replace-loader)
- [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)
- [`sass-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader)

## Resolve aliases

Through `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration.

To configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      resolveAlias: {
        underscore: 'lodash',
        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.

Turbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.

## Resolve extensions

Through `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's [`resolve.extensions`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) configuration.

To configure resolve extensions, use the `resolveExtensions` field in `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      resolveExtensions: [
        '.mdx',
        '.tsx',
        '.ts',
        '.jsx',
        '.js',
        '.mjs',
        '.json',
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

This overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.
