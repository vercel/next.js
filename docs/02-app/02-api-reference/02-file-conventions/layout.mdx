A **layout** is UI that is shared between routes.

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.js" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

A **root layout** is the top-most layout in the root `app` directory. It is used to define the `<html>` and `<body>` tags and other globally shared UI.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Props

### `children` (required)

Layout components should accept and use a `children` prop. During rendering, `children` will be populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping. These will primarily be the component of a child [Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages) (if it exists) or [Page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages), but could also be other special files like [Loading](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) or [Error](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) when applicable.

### `params` (optional)

The [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) object from the root segment down to that layout.

| Example                           | URL            | `params`                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| `app/dashboard/[team]/layout.js`  | `/dashboard/1` | `{ team: '1' }`           |
| `app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js` | `/shop/1/2`    | `{ tag: '1', item: '2' }` |
| `app/blog/[...slug]/layout.js`    | `/blog/1/2`    | `{ slug: ['1', '2'] }`    |

For example:

```tsx filename="app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function ShopLayout({
  children,
  params,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  params: {
    tag: string
    item: string
  }
}) {
  // URL -> /shop/shoes/nike-air-max-97
  // `params` -> { tag: 'shoes', item: 'nike-air-max-97' }
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js" switcher
export default function ShopLayout({ children, params }) {
  // URL -> /shop/shoes/nike-air-max-97
  // `params` -> { tag: 'shoes', item: 'nike-air-max-97' }
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

## Good to know

### Layouts do not receive `searchParams`

Unlike [Pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), Layout components **do not** receive the `searchParams` prop. This is because a shared layout is [not re-rendered during navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering) which could lead to stale `searchParams` between navigations.

When using client-side navigation, Next.js automatically only renders the part of the page below the common layout between two routes.

For example, in the following directory structure, `dashboard/layout.tsx` is the common layout for both `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`:

<Image
  alt="File structure showing a dashboard folder nesting a layout.tsx file, and settings and analytics folders with their own pages"
  srcLight="/docs/light/shared-dashboard-layout.png"
  srcDark="/docs/dark/shared-dashboard-layout.png"
  width="1600"
  height="687"
/>

When navigating from `/dashboard/settings` to `/dashboard/analytics`, `page.tsx` in `/dashboard/analytics` will rerender on the server, while `dashboard/layout.tsx` will **not** rerender because it's a common UI shared between the two routes.

This performance optimization allows navigation between pages that share a layout to be quicker as only the data fetching and rendering for the page has to run, instead of the entire route that could include shared layouts that fetch their own data.

Because `dashboard/layout.tsx` doesn't re-render, the `searchParams` prop in the layout Server Component might become **stale** after navigation.

- Instead, use the Page [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop or the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest `searchParams`.

### Root Layouts

- The `app` directory **must** include a root `app/layout.js`.
- The root layout **must** define `<html>` and `<body>` tags.
  - You should **not** manually add `<head>` tags such as `<title>` and `<meta>` to root layouts. Instead, you should use the [Metadata API](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating `<head>` elements.
- You can use [route groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to create multiple root layouts.
  - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts.
